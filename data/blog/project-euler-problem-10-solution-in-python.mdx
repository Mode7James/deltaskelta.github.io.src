## The Problem States

```text
The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17. Find the sum of all the primes below two million.
```

## My Solution

I originally had a solution that I was about to post, but it took way too long (200+ seconds) The method I was using
was pretty straightforward...

I was trying to build a list, take out all the even numbers, and then check the rest for being prime using the fast
is_prime function I wrote in a few problems back ([Problem 7](http://chivyleague.com/project-euler-problem-7-solution-in-python/),
the problem with that is that it was still looping through 2 million numbers and checking for primes through trial
division, even though the trial division was efficient, it still wasn't enough when taking into account appending or
removing from a list, checking the next number, blah, blah.

I found the Sieve of Eratosthenes explanation and thought I would try that. I generated a list of possible numbers,
then built a complex loop that first tested for a prime, and then if it was found to be prime it would go through the
list and remove all the multiples of that number, and then move onto the next one. I thought for sure this would work
but it ended up taking way too long and I didn't know why.

Then as I was reading [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19345627/python-prime-numbers-sieve-of-eratosthenes),
it hit me. It was because my numbers were big, and some of them were really big. if I'm testing a number like 1276733
for primality it is going to take up a lot of memory. If I could instead substitute the numbers for a list of 1's and
0's or True/False then it would go much quicker in the machine.

I'll comment the code below to explain how it works, it was an eye opener for me.

```python
limit = int(input(&quot;what is the upper limit:&quot;))

import time
start_time = time.clock()

#My empty list of primes and the sieve, there will be 2,000,000 [True]'s here
primes = []
sieve = [True] * limit

# I started with the first prime, 2. if sieve[2] (remember, thats index 2) is true
#append it to the empty primes list. Then for the range of i + i (2 + 2) until the
#limit (2,000,000), skipping by two (4, 6, 8, 10...) make the sieve False
for i in range(2, limit):
    if sieve[i]:
        primes.append(i)
        for j in range(i + i, limit, i):
            sieve[j] = False

total = 0
for i in primes:
    total += i

print('the sum of the primes is:', total, '\n'
      'the first 20 primes are:', primes[0:19], '\n'
      'the sieve looks like:', sieve[0:19])
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
what is the upper limit:2000000
the sum of the primes is: 142913828922
the first 20 primes are: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67]
the sieve looks like: [True, True, True, True, False, True, False, True, False, False, False, True, False, True, False, False, False, True, False]
finished in: 3.2108584076775775 seconds
```

You can see in the output above that the sieve worked perfectly. I entered 2,000,000 as my limit, so there were 2,000,
000 Trues in there (one for every number from 0-1,999,999). If you start counting at 0 and count the 'Trues,' you can
see that it matches up with the prime numbers perfectly
