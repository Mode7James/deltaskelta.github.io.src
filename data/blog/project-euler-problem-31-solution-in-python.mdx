## The Problem States

```text
In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:

1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p).

It is possible to make £2 in the following way:
1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p

How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
```

## My Solution

I think the best way to go about this would be to create some lists that contain all the values in multiples of the
coins. So the 1p list will contain 1, 2, 3, 4...200 while the 5p list would contain 5, 10, 15...200 that way I have
every multiple of each coin and I can loop through each value of each coin and try all the combinations, any counting
every time it hits 200. I didn't know what else to do and it was easy to write, so I let it run while I tried to find
another solution.

## Brute Force Solution

I left out the 2 pound and started the count at one since there is only one way to make change for 2 pounds with a 2 pound coin.

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()
one = [i for i in range(0, 201)]
two = [i for i in range(0, 201) if i % 2 == 0]
five = [i for i in range(0, 201) if i % 5 == 0]
ten = [i for i in range(0, 201) if i % 10 == 0]
twenty = [i for i in range(0, 201) if i % 20 == 0]
fifty = [i for i in range(0, 201) if i % 50 == 0]
pound = [i for i in range(0, 201) if i % 100 == 0]

count = 1
for i in one:
    for j in two:
        for k in five:
            for l in ten:
                for m in twenty:
                     for n in fifty:
                        for o in pound:
                            temp = i + j + k + l + m + n + o
                            if temp == 200:
                                count += 1

print(count)
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

This is a terrible solution, but I have decided to leave it for now since the other solutions seem confusing to me
