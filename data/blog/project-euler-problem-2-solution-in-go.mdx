## The Problem States

```text
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the
first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
```

## My Solution

I created a bunch of `uint32` variables that would take care of the current, previous, and answer variables. I didn't
know how big the answer would be so I gave them 32 bits to be safe. I then made a `for` loop (which functions like
`while` in go) and checked if the current number was divisible by 2.

I then created the next set of Fibonacci numbers by addition and let the loop continue

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  var current, previous, answer uint32 = 1, 0, 0

  for ; current < 4000000 ; {
    if current % 2 == 0 {
      answer += current
    }
    tmp := current
    current = current + previous
    previous = tmp
  }

  fmt.Println(answer)
}
```
