Find the thirteen adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product. What is the value of this product?
```

## My Solution:

First of all, I wanted to import the file from a text file to treat it as if it were too big to handle by hand. I
saves the number as a file and imported it.

The numbers were then listed as strings with '\n' for a new line. I appended them to a list if they were not '\n' and
made them integers. At this point I had a long, uninterrupted list of numbers and I wasn't sure if I should separate
them by line or not. The problem was a little bit vague so I just decided to try and solve it and if I had any
problems with the answer then I would split them up.

I used for loops to get the right list of factors and then another for loop to multiply them together and add them to
a dictionary.

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

#opening assigning and closing the file with the numbers
my_file = open('Euler8number.txt', 'r')
number = my_file.read()
my_file.close()

#Getting rid of the annoying '\n' in the numbers and making list of ints
number_list = []
for i in number:
    if i == '\n':
        pass
    else:
        number_list.append(int(i))

#Initializing variables I will need for the loop
fac_prod = {}
start_index = 0
stop_index = 13
for i in number_list:
    factors = number_list[start_index:stop_index]

    #After I made the list of factors, I made another loop here to multiply them together
    product = 1
    for j in factors:
        product *= j

    #I then added them to this dictionary
    fac_prod[product] = factors

    #I then increased the start and stop indexes by one for the next loop
    start_index += 1
    stop_index += 1
    if stop_index > 1000:
        break

print()
print('the product:', max(fac_prod), 'was given by the factors:', fac_prod[max(fac_prod)])

print()
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output:

```bash
the product: 23514624000 was given by the factors: [5, 5, 7, 6, 6, 8, 9, 6, 6, 4, 8, 9, 5]

finished in: 0.012834164227012298 seconds
```
