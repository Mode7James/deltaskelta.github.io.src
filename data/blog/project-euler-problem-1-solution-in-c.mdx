Starting with C in project Euler to get a better understanding of how C works.


## The Problem States

```
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
```

The solution is pretty easy after going through some beginning C tutorials.

## My Solution

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int x;
    int sum = 0;

    for (x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
            if ( x % 3 == 0 || x % 5 == 0 ) {
                    sum = sum + x;
            }
    }
    printf( "The sum of the multiples of 3 and 5 below 1000 is %d\n", sum );
}
```

I had one strange problem that is different from anything I have experienced before. I had forgotten to assign a
value to the variable of `sum` and then it was coming through as 32797 and then auto incrementing upwards by 3, 5, 6
and so on. I guess it is because it creates the variable at some point in memory and then doesn't reassign what is in
the memory so I had to change it to `int sum = 0;` to fully initialize and assign the variable.

I [posted on stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36759717/c-variable-has-a-value-already) about the
problem as well and got a pretty good explanation there

## The Output

```bash
The sum of the multiples of 3 and 5 below 1000 is 233168
```
