## The Problem States

```text
215 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.

What is the sum of the digits of the number 21000?
```

## My Solution

The GNU GMP library does most of the work here because I cannot handle big numbers in C without creating new
datatypes, which the library GMP does for me.

There are a lot of long function names, they all come from the GMP library and they are for dealing with the
arbitrarily large number datatypes that GMP creates. The code just sets `2^1000` and then goes through and floor
divides (`mpz_fdiv_q_ui`) by 10, pulling out the last digit and adding it to the sum. The `while` loop does this
while the sign (`mpz_sgn`) of `result` is positive

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <gmp.h>

int main ()
{
  clock_t start = clock();

  mpz_t result;
  mpz_init(result);
  unsigned long int two = 2;
  unsigned long int exponent = 1000;
  mpz_ui_pow_ui(result, two, exponent);

  int sum = 0;
  while (mpz_sgn(result)) {
    int r = mpz_fdiv_q_ui(result, result, 10);
    sum += r;
  }
  printf("%i\n", sum);

  clock_t end = clock();
    double time_elapsed_in_seconds = (end - start)/(double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
    printf("Finished in %f seconds.\n", time_elapsed_in_seconds);
}
```

## The Output

```text
1366
Finished in 0.000188 seconds.
```
