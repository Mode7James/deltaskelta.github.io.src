## The Problem States

```text
Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

21 22 23 24 25
20  7  8  9 10
19  6  1  2 11
18  5  4  3 12
17 16 15 14 13

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
```

## My Solution

My first thought was to just build a function which filled up the square with all the numbers and then run through
the diagonals and add them up. I knew there was probably an easier way, but making the computer fill up all those
numbers in order seemed like a challenge and I decided to do that first. It was terribly inefficient because there is
obviously a pattern to how the numbers are filled in so I went back and made a more efficient solution as well.

## The Efficient Solution

The function adds up the corners of a square assuming that it is filled in the way the problem states. The top right
corner will always just be the length x height since it will essentially  contain the area or all the numbers within
the square. Then it is simply as much as taking the following

```text
(side^2) + (side^2 - 1  * side) + (side^2 - 2 * side) + (side^2 - 3 * side)
```

That will give me the sum of all four corners of a single square, counting by square number

```text
(square 1 sides = 3, 5, 7, 9 square 2 sides = 13, 17, 21, 25)
```

I then made a for loop to add up all the squares for a 1001 x 1001 square.

```python
import time

def square_diag(x):
    #x is going to be the length of the square sides
    y = x - 1
    cor_sum = 4 * x ** 2 - 6 * y # 4x^2 - 6y
    #This equation was simplified a lot, but it finds the sum of the four corners, given the length of one of the
    #sides, assuming that the square is built according to the problem
    #The original equation was (x ** 2) + (x ** 2 - y) + (x ** 2 - 2*y) + (x ** 2 - 3*y)
    return cor_sum

sq_sz = int(input('What size square would you like to add the diagonals for? '))
start_time = time.clock()

square_no = int((sq_sz - 1)/2)
diags = 0
for i in range(1, square_no + 1):
    #The range had to be the actual square number, square one being the first 3x3 square after the center '1'
    #Because I am adding up concentric square numbers, not side lengths.
    x = i * 2 + 1
   diags += square_diag(x)
else:
    diags += 1
    print('the total of the diagonals is:', diags)

print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
What size square would you like to add the diagonals for? 1001
the total of the diagonals is: 669171001
finished in: 0.0022070184126316205 seconds
```

## The Inefficient Solution

I basically made a grid of a certain size, filled it in with all the numbers using logic and then made a couple for
loops to sum the diagonals. I did it will a 5 x 5 square here so you could actually see the output. With a 1001 x
1001 square and no printing of the square it takes about 4 seconds.

```python
import time
from aFormulas import make_grid
start_time = time.clock()

size = 5
g = make_grid(size, size)

xlen, ylen = len(g[0]), len(g)
x, y = int(xlen/2), int(ylen/2)
# x and y will be rounded down from .5 so that will put them at the perfect index spot

g[y][x] = 1
x += 1
g[y][x] = 2
# In order to save on loop logic, I did the first and second move already because they are somewhat special moves

curr = 2
for i in range(len(g)):
    for j in range(len(g)):
        # Current number is 2, so the next number will be +1 everytime
        curr += 1
        if x < 0 and y < 0:
            # It got stuck on the last edges from indexerrrors so I made those go in the else loop
            if g[y][x - 1] != 0 and g[y + 1][x] == 0:
                # For when the left is solid, but down is open, move down
                y += 1
                g[y][x] = curr
            elif g[y - 1][x] != 0 and g[y][x - 1] == 0 and y != 0:
                # When up is solid, but left is open, move left
                x -= 1
                g[y][x] = curr
            elif g[y][x + 1] != 0 and g[y - 1][x] == 0:
                # When right is solid, but up is open, move up
                y -= 1
                g[y][x] = curr
            elif g[y + 1][x] != 0 and g[y][x + 1] == 0:
                # When down is solid, but right is open, move right
                x += 1
               g[y][x] = curr
        else:
            if g[y - 1][x] == 0 and y < 0:
                # For the last go around when going upwards, will fail when it gets to to row
                y -= 1
                g[y][x] = curr
            elif g[y][x + 1] == 0 and x < size - 2:
                # For the top row going right, will fail on the last number
                x += 1
                g[y][x] = curr
            else:
                # I had to break here, because otherwise it would keep looping for the first two numbers
                # This line makes the last number
                x += 1
                g[y][x] = curr
                break

# Time to sum the diagonals -------------------------------------
for i in g:
    print(i)

x, y = 0, 0
fds = 0
for i in range(0, size):
    # Forward diagonal sum
    fds += g[y][x]
    y += 1
    x += 1

x, y = 0, size - 1
bds = 0
for i in range(0, size):
    # Backward diagonal sum
    bds += g[y][x]
    y -= 1
    x += 1

print(fds + bds - 1)
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```
