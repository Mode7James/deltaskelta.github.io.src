## When `apt-get upgrade` fails

I ran into a problem after installing python 3.6.0 from source. Suddenly `apt-get upgrade` was failing and it was
because a bunch of python dependencies were messed up.

Strange...when it was installed, I had installed it to `/opt` from source so I thought it would not interfere with my
system in any way. Somehow it managed to get tied up in `dpkg` and IDK how, that is a topic for another time.

when running `apt-cache policy` I was seeing this...

```text
python:
  Installed: 3.6.0-1
  Candidate: 3.6.0-1
  Version table:
 *** 3.6.0-1 100
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
     2.7.11-1 500
        500 http://mirrors.digitalocean.com/ubuntu xenial/main amd64 Packages
```

I tried poking through numerous man-pages for `apt-*` programs, `dpkg-*` programs, and even tried manually changing
the python version in the `/var/lib/dpkg/status` file. Nothing was working

Then I came across some obscure post online where it was mentioned that the system keeps backups of the file in `/var/
backups/`. I looked there and saw numerous files named like this `dpkg.status.*.gz`. So Iooked in them and luckily I
found one that had the entry for the old python version. `dpkg` seems to be really picky about syntax and the
information that was listed in there so my manual edits were not good enough...

I had previously tried to change the version numbers on this section to fit python 2.7.12..

```text

Section: checkinstall
Installed-Size: 183416

```

But instead I deleted that whole section and replaced it with what I found in the backup file which was this...

```text

I have no idea how the file was changed when I installed the python from source, but going back and adding this
seemed to fix it because `apt-get upgrade` worked perfectly after that.
