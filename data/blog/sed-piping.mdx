1. what am I trying to write here? ( I am trying to write about sed piping stuff to xargs )
2. come up with a solid example that doesnt include goass (DO NOT COMMIT THIS)

this one worked

gopass show misc/ | grep "├── \|└──" | sed 's/├── /misc\//g' | xargs -tn1 gopass show

this one did not work, it needs to do something with replacing the @'s or _'s

gopass show websites/ | grep " └── " | sed -r 's/│?   └── /websites\//g' | xargs -tn1 gopass show
