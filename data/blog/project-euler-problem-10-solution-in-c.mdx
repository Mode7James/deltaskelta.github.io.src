## The Problem States

```text
The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

Find the sum of all the primes below two million.
```

## My Solution

I had already written a prime function for another problem so I used it here. It will return 1 if the input is prime
and return 0 if it is not.

I just looped through all the numbers unbder 2 million and added them to a total sum if they were prime, and printed
the result.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <math.h>

int is_prime(int num)
{
  int sqrtDiv = lround(sqrt(num));
  while (sqrtDiv > 1) {
    if (num % sqrtDiv == 0) {
      return(0);
    } else {
      sqrtDiv--;
    }
  }
  return(1);
}

int main ()
{
  //Getting the clock time from the time.h header
  clock_t start = clock();

  long sum = 0;
  for ( int i = 2; i < 2000000; i++ ) {
    if (is_prime(i)) {
      sum += i;
    }
  }
  printf("Sum of primes below 2,000,000 is: %ld\n", sum);

  //Setting the end clock and printint the elapsed time
  clock_t end = clock();
    double time_elapsed_in_seconds = (end - start)/(double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
    printf("Finished in %f seconds.\n", time_elapsed_in_seconds);
}
```

## The Output

```text
Sum of primes below 2,000,000 is: 142913828922
Finished in 4.572524 seconds.
```

I wrote this same function in python and it took nearly 200 seconds to complete, it is amazing how much faster C is
in this instance than python.
