- Choose features of <InlineMath math="x^{(i)}"/> that you think might be likely to be anomalous in the desired way.
- Fit the average and standard deviation of each of the features

<BlockMath math="
  \begin{aligned}
    \mu_j &= \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m x^{(i)}_j \\
    \sigma^2_j &= \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m (x_j^{(i)} - \mu_j)^2
  \end{aligned}
"/>

- Given a new example x, compute p(x)

<BlockMath math="
  p(x)
  = \prod_{j=1}^n p(x_j;\mu_j,\sigma^2_j)
  = \prod_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma_j}} exp(- \frac{(x_j - \mu_j)^2}{2 \sigma^2_j})
"/>

The last step gives the Gaussian probability, meaning that if a feature is more standard deviations away from the mean,
then it has a smaller Gaussian probability. Therefore, the last product part multiplied the Gaussian probabilities for
each feature of the example together. If all of the features lie somewhere close to the mean then the resulting number
will be relatively larger, and if the numbers are many standard deviations away from the mean then `p(x)` will be very
small. The example is considered an anomaly if it is smaller than some predetermined <InlineMath math="\epsilon"/>
threshold.
