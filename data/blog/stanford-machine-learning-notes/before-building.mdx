Before starting to build a network, it would be best to think very carefully about how to best go about it by
brainstorming and testing ideas as much as possible. In the example of building a spam classifier, one could

- Collect lots of data
- Develop sophisticated features such as the email routing and header information
- Develop algorithms to process the input in different ways

When starting it would be best to learn about the provlem first. This is often done by tinkering with it on toy examples
to see what the specific issues with the problem set are. A good approach would be to

- Write a simple algorithm and test it on the cross validation data
- Plot learning curves to decide if more data (possibly when there is high variance and overfitting) or more features
  (possibly when there is high bias, and underfitting) are needed
- Manually examine the cross validation set errors that were made to see if you can find a specific type of example that
  it is failing on.

## Precision vs. Recall vs Accuracy

Accuracy is defined as <M i="\frac{\text{True positives + True negatives}}{total examples}"/>. This gives
the overall correctness of the predictions.

Precision is the ratio of how many of the true classifications on the cross validation set were actually
correct <M i="\frac{\text{True positive}}{\text{True positive} + \text{False positive}}" />.
In other words, of all of the predicted `true`s, how many were actually true. Recall is a similar metric that
measures the ratio of <M i="\frac{\text{True positives}}{\text{True positives} + \text{False negatives}}"/>.

These ratios are useful in the case that there is a high error rate. Perhaps just predicting 0 all the time would give a
lower error rate that actually running the algorithm. In that case though, we are not doing anything so the precision
and recall rates would both be 0. In order to influence the amount of recall and precision, we can change the point at
which the hypothesis is considereed to output true or false. If the true prediction threshold is greateer than `0.9`
this would lead to having more precision, but we will also have a higher false negagive rate. If the threshold is moved
in the other direction, and we predict one when the hypothesis predicts anything higer than `0.1` then we will have few
false negatives but many false positives (higher recall, lower precision).

Ideally, both of these ratios would be high, meaning that the algorithm is largely predicting things correctly. In some
cases though, it may be better to err on the side of caution. For instance, would it be acceptable to have a higher
false positive flag or a higher false negative flag?

In order to help choose a proper acceptable precision vs recall would be to use the following formula

<M b="F_1 Score = 2 \frac{PR}{P+R}" />

With this formula, if precision or recall is 0 (meaning that we were just predicting 1 or 0 the whole time), then the
output score will be 0 (not good). A score closer to 1 is generally better.

## Working With Large Datasets

- One should ask if a human expert would be able to give insight with the feature set or not.
- Use an algorithm with many parameters and many features, many hidden units. This is likely to make an algorithm which
  can fit complex functions and have low bias
- Use a large training set, unlikely to overfit the data (low variance)
