ever feature should have a scale of approximately -1 to 1 in order to make the gradient descent an easier process. As
long as t is something small and consistent.

Another way to go about it is to normalize the mean to 0 and divide by the range of values. the `mu` is the average of
all the values. In the example given, the average house age was 38 years and the range of values were from 30 to 50
years. This means that for th eaverage case, the value would be 0

<BlockMath math="\frac{x_i - \mu_i}{s_i}" />
