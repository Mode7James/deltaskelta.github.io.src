## The Problem States

```text
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
```

## My Solution

I had a little trouble getting this to run, it kept going into a feedback loop and crashing. I think I discovered
that I could not set a variable equal to a functions return if the function takes that variable as an input. I had to
declare a new variable and then everything was fine.

The first function tests for primality by seeing if any number up to the square root of a number is evenly divisible,
it returns false if the number is not prime and returns the number if it is prime.

Then the second function finds the largest prime factor by looping through until the square root of the number, if it
finds an evenly divisible factor, then it gets the other factor (because one must be above the square root and one
must be below the square root.) and checks them individually for being prime and then changes the largestPrimeFactor
variable if it is bigger than it.

## The Code

```javascript
function is_prime(num) {
    if (num === 0 || num === 1) {return false}
    if (num === 2) {return 2}
    var sqrt = Math.sqrt(num)
    for (var i = 2; i < sqrt + 1; i++) {
        if (num % i === 0) {
            return false
        }
    }
    return num
}

function LPF(num) {
    var sqrt = Math.sqrt(num);
    var biggestPrimeFactor = false
    for (var i = 2; i < sqrt + 1; i++) {
        if (num % i === 0) {
            var two = is_prime(num / i)
            var one = is_prime(i)
            if (one &amp;&amp; one > biggestPrimeFactor) {biggestPrimeFactor = one}
            if (two &amp;&amp; two > biggestPrimeFactor) {biggestPrimeFactor = two}
        }
    }
    return biggestPrimeFactor
}

console.log(LPF(600851475143))
```

## The Output

```text
6857
