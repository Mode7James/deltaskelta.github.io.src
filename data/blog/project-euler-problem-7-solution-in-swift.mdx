## The Problem States

```text
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10 001st prime number?
```

## My Solution

I had to first create a function to test whether or not a number is prime and from there it was pretty easy.

```swift
func is_prime(num:Int) -> Bool {
    let sq = sqrt(Double(num))

    for i in 2...Int(sq) + 1 {
        if num % i == 0 {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true

}

func problem7() {
    var primes:Int = 1
    var next:Int = 3

    while primes < 10001 {
        if is_prime(next) {
            primes += 1
        }
        next += 1
    }
    print("The 10,001st prime is: ", next - 1)
}

problem7()
```

## The Output

I wrote this in Python and in C before and they were both insanely fast. This takes forever though (~2-3 minutes) and
I am not sure why. I think it has something to do with the swift interpreter in XCode, but I have no idea how to fix
it. I think I already have the most efficient solution, so...

```text
"The 10,001st prime is: 104743"
```
