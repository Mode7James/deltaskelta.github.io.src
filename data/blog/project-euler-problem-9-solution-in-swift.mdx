## The Problem States

```text
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

a2 + b2 = c2
For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.
```

## My Solution

I know that `a < b < c` so I know I can eliminate counting some numbers right away. I didn't see any other way to do
this besides just going through 3 nested loops and trying all the multiplication.

I added the `return -1` just in case I made a mistake or the problem was wrong so I could get a C style return value
and know right away that there was something wrong.

```swift
public func problem9 () -> Int {
    for i in 1..<1000 {
        for j in (i+1)..<1000 {
            for k in (j+1)..<1000 {
                if (i*i + j*j == k*k) && (i + j + k == 1000) {
                    return(i*j*k)
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return(-1)
}
```

## The Output

```text
"31875000\n"
```
