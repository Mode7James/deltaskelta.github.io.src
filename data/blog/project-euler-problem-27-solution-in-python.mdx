## The Problem States

```text
Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

n² + n + 41

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 39. However, when n = 40, 40^
2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible by 41, and certainly when n = 41, 41² + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.

The incredible formula  n² − 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to
79. The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.

Considering quadratics of the form:
n² + an + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| < 1000
where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n. e.g. |11| = 11 and |−4| = 4

Find the product of the coefficients, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum
number of primes for consecutive values of <i>n</i>, starting with <i>n</i> = 0.
```

## My Solution

1. I should go to a certain A and B value and then iterate through n to see how many primes are generated.
2. I break when n + a = b because the formula simplified is n(n + a) + b. Therefore is n + a is b then every higher n will not be prime.
3. A and B can be anywhere between -999 and 999 but b must always be prime, because when n is 0 b must be prime by itself or the sequence will never get to even the first term

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

def quadratic_prime(n, a, b):
    #n^2 + an + b
    ans = n ** 2 + a * n + b
    return ans

n = 0
a = [i for i in range(-999, 1000)]
b = [i for i in range(-999, 1000) if aFormulas.is_prime(i)]
p_max = [0, 0, 0]
for i in a:
    for j in b:
        while aFormulas.is_prime(quadratic_prime(n, i, j)):
            n += 1
        else:
            if n > p_max[0]:
                p_max[0], p_max[1], p_max[2] = n, i, j
            n = 0
else:
    print(p_max)

print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
[71, -61, 971]
finished in: 26.398129272864193 seconds
 ```
