I wanted to take down an old wordpress blog I had and migrate all the posts to this site, but there were too many to
copy and paste here so I was able to...

* Dump the *wp_posts* column from my wp database into a JSON file (in phpMyAdmin)
* Write a small python function to extract the posts and data I wanted
* Write another function for creating the *BlogPost* objects that I wanted

Here is an example of the script in case anyone needs an idea of how to write it, this is probably horribly written...

```python
import json
#These should the model names you need
from blog.models import BlogPost, BlogTag
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
User = get_user_model()

def wp():
  wp = open('wp_posts.json')
  data = json.load(wp)
  posts = []
  for i in data:
    x = {}
    #There were many revisions stored, the published post was only the final post...
    if i['post_status'] == 'publish':
      x['post_title'] = i['post_title']
      x['post_date'] = i['post_date']
      #post content was all rendered into HTML, IDK if that is form the html in my setup
      #or just normal wordpress, either way I'll have to remove it later
      x['post_content'] = i['post_content']
      x['post_slug'] = i['post_name']
      #Asking if I wanted to save it since I didn't want them all
      save = raw_input('save? %s: ' % x['post_title'])
      while save != 'y' and save != 'n':
        save = raw_input('y or n only: ')
        if save == 'y':
            posts.append(x)
        elif save == 'n':
            pass

      dumpfile = open('post_dump.json', 'w+')
      dumpfile.write(json.dumps(posts))

def make():
  thefile = open('post_dump.json')
  data = json.load(thefile)
  p_author = User.objects.get(username=*my_username*)
  tag = BlogTag.objects.get(title=*my_tag_title*)



for i in data:
  BlogPost.objects.create(
    author=p_author,
    title=i['post_title'],
    slug=i['post_slug'],
    post=i['post_content'],
  )
```

This gave me all the posts, but I will still have to go through and edit them to remove all the html I don't want and
to fix the images and make everything work with my site. I skipped the date because my current model automatically
defines it, but I might go back in the future and put the correct publish date on everything since I still have it in
the *post_dump.json* file.
