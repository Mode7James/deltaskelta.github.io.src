## The Problem States

```text
2^15 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.

What is the sum of the digits of the number 2^1000?
```

## My Solution

This was pretty easy compared to the last few problems, so it took almost no time at all. Basically I had to
calculate 2^1000, Â and turn it into a string so I could iterate through it digit by digit. I looped through all of
the string digits, first turning them back into integers and then adding them to a sum.

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

n = 2 ** 1000
n = str(n)

sum = 0
for i in n:
    i = int(i)
    sum += i

print('2^1000 is:', n)
print('the sum of all the digits of 2^1000 is:', sum)
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
2^1000 is: 10715086071862673209484250490600018105614048117055336074437503883703510511249361224931983788156958581275946729175531468251871452856923140435984577574698574803934567774824230985421074605062371141877954182153046474983581941267398767559165543946077062914571196477686542167660429831652624386837205668069376

the sum of all the digits of 2^1000 is: 1366
finished in: 0.00047937777534501515 seconds
```
