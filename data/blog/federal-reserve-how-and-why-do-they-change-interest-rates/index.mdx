There is a lot of misinformation about the Federal Reserve floating around and a good portion makes it out to be
evil. This happens for a few reasons:

1. It affects everyone
2. Many people don't have the slightest clue what it does
3. It has controls something that everyone has, wants, and needs...money

This scares people into thinking going back to a system that is backed by gold or some other hard commodity would be
better than having a black box organization of people in the Fed. It sounds great because gold has always been
valuable, will always stay valuable, and the dirty Fed can't mess with it. But is that all really true? Would it have
the effect that so many people desire?

##  What is true?

1. The Federal Reserve **IS** an entity within the US government, not a privately owned corporation
([http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_14986.htm](http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_14986.htm))
2. The Federal Reserve **IS** listed as a government agency.
([http://www.usa.gov/directory/federal/F.shtml](http://www.usa.gov/directory/federal/F.shtml))
3. The 12 regional branches of the Federal Reserve **DO** issue stock to private corporations, but that doesn't
mean the banks own the Fed.

> Reserve Banks is not available for purchase by individuals or entities other than member banks.

So, the stockholders of each regional branch elect Class A and B directors (Class A represent financial institutions,
and Class B represent the public) while the Board of Governor's in Washington elects Class C directors. Class B and C
directors may not be employed by a financial institution and Class C members may not own any stock in member
institutions (banks). ([http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/frseries/frseri4.htm](http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/frseries/frseri4.htm))
Banks and consumers are both represented.

That is how the system is setup contrary to what anyone else may say. From this point if they want to go deeper and
speculate as to the amount of political influence or control the member banks have over the Fed then that is a
separate issue entirely and needs to be addressed as such.

##  What are the functions of the central bank

## How does the Fed move interest rates

By controlling interest rates, AKA: "influencing the monetary and credit conditions..." The Fed purchases bonds from
the U.S. Treasury on the private market. This means they are taking previously issued bonds (U.S. Treasury debt) out
of circulation, and putting more currency into circulation. The effect is an increase in price and a decrease in
effective yield of the bonds. Remember they were already issued from the treasury to someone else at a
[par value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_value), [interest rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate), and
[maturity date](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturity_%28finance%29).

This act increases the supply of money in the economy because the money that the Fed used to buy the bonds was not
previously in circulation. That ultimately ends up in the banks which they use to create new loans. An infusion of
cash into banks means that the banks are more likely to lend out the money at lower rates. If the supply of money 
goes up (inversely, the supply of debt goes down) then the interest rate will fall.

How is the supply of money tied to the demand for debt? The supply of debt goes down because the Fed has bought a lot
of it up and taken it out of circulation. Less supply of debt means that the buyers of it (people who want to make
money from interest) will have to pay a higher price. Sellers can wait for a better price, or lower effective
interest rate on the outstanding debt. The Fed buys this debt with cash that is then left in the economy. What
happens when there is extra money laying around? People don't usually stuff it in their mattress or plant it in the
ground hoping it will grow a tree. They usually loan it out at interest to make more money. So there is more money on
the market available to loan (higher supply). Both congruent situations have the effect of lowering interest rates.

Of course if they wanted to raise interest rates they would do everything the opposite way. The Fed would take U.S.
Treasury bonds that they currently have on their balance sheet and sell them into the open market, which would
increase the supply of debt and decrease the supply of money (they would be inserting bonds into the market and
removing the money they received for them). The supply of money will go down and the supply of debt will go up. In
this case buyers of debt (people who want to make money from loaning money out at interest) can hold out for better
deals (higher interest rates)

##  Just follow the flow of  money...

<props.imgs.Img3 align="right" width="40%" />

The Fed can intervene in the economy and make adjustments as needed to prevent it from stalling, becoming too strong,
or too weak. The process works because the central bank has the authority to bring money in and out of existence.
They are the only point in the whole system with the unlimited ability to produce money. Another organization may be
able to influence the open market for a period time, but the central bank will always be able to overpower their
influence with an infinite supply of money. Ideas of going back to the gold standard may sound appealing at first but
there are countless problems that would arise from it.

## What happens when wages become too high for them to be sustained? Or prices fluctuate?

Would workers agree to a pay-cut in order to keep their jobs? Or would they strike and constantly demand higher
wages? Even though inflation is one of the causes of the need for higher wages, gold would cause severe price swings
due to trade imbalances while workers would need to constantly be adjusting to new salary levels that wouldn't
necessarily match the prices. The economy would be booming and crashing constantly. Not only do you have the raw
effects of an unstable economy, but the consumers perception of stability and safety would also go out the window.

#### What happens when gold is hoarded off the market causing liquidity problems? What happens when that gold is suddenly injected back into the market?

Gold can be taken out of circulation in the same way that the supply of money is done right now by the Fed. All it
takes is someone with a sufficient supply of gold to move the market *cough* governments *cough*. If the world would
somehow adopt the gold standard, then you would not only be subject to your own governments expansion and contraction
of the money supply, but that of foreign governments as well since they now use the same currency.

## There would still be inflation with gold.

What happens when more gold is mined out of the earth? It will cause inflation just like it does now, except it will
not be controlled  and monitored like it is now. It may go through periods of extreme inflation, to deflation, etc.
The whole job of the Fed is to keep this balancing act as stable as possible so the economy can go and do its thing
without being bothered.

## Gold is always valuable, so it must make a good currency, right?

Gold is seen as valuable because it has a high value to weight ratio. Right now if weighted equally, gold is worth 47
times as much as dollars. (1 Dollar = 1 gram while 1 gram of gold is worth $47)  Something of perceived high value
seems logical to become a currency, but value is also relative.

In the past years gold has had enormous price fluctuations

A 10% move in the price of a dollar would be seen as a huge move. Just look at the massive increase in gold prices
from '05 to '11...

That's a 440% increase in the  price of gold over 6 years. The massive 10% possible fluctuation in the price of the
dollar is looking pretty stable right about now isn't it? Economies cannot withstand that rapid of price movements.

## So Why does the Fed change interest rates?

They do it to avoid shocks to the economy which could be harmful to consumers. In the end, gold would lead to many
more shocks to the economy. It simply does not operate as people dream it does. The reality is that it would be far
too volatile for any economy to handle.
