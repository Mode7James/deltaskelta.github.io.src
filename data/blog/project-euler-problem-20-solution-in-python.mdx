## The Problem States

```text
n! means n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1

For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800,
and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.

Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!
```

## My Solution

This is pretty straightforward, just make a function that will do the factorial and then turn it into a string,
iterate through it and turn it back into an integer and add it up.

```python
import time

def factorial(x):
    x = int(x)
    n = x
    while n > 1:
        x *= n-1
        n -= 1
    return x

#I made the user input the number they would like to factorial and sum, time is started after that is input by the user
num = input('what factorial would you like to sum:')
fac = str(factorial(num))
start_time = time.clock()

count = 0
for i in fac:
    count += int(i)

print('the sum of all digits in the factorial is:', count)
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
what factorial would you like to sum:100
the sum of all digits in the factorial is: 648
finished in: 0.00023434346198846414 seconds
```
