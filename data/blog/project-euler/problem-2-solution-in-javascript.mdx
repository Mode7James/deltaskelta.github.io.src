## The Problem States

```text
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the
first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the
even-valued terms.
```

## My Solution

I made an array with starting fib values, then a function to calculate and add the next fib number to the array. It
return the number, so I then made a loop that continued until it got a return value above 4,000,000 and added all the
numbers together.

## The Code

```javascript
var fibs = [0, 1]

function nextFib(fibArray) {
    var len = fibArray.length
    var next = fibArray[len - 1] + fibArray[len - 2]
    fibArray.push(next)
    return next
}

var sum = 0
for(var i = fibs[fibs.length - 1]; i < 4000000; i = nextFib(fibs)) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
    sum += i
    }
}

console.log(sum)
```

## The Output

```text
4613732
```
