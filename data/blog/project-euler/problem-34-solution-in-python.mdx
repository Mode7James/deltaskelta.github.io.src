## The Problem States

145 is a curious number, as <M i="1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145" />.

Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.
Note: as 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.

## My Solution

This was pretty straightforward, but I was having trouble with my factorial function that I wrote before because I
did not account for the fact that 0! is 1. I was only coming up with 145 because that number did not have any 0's but
the only other number that can be written like that was off by one.

I stored the factorials of the digits 0-9 and then iterated through a range turning the numbers into a string and
then iterating through that and summing up the factorial of each digit. If the sum was equal to the original number I
added it to a final sum.

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

#Returns factorial of x
def factorial(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 1
    next_n = x - 1
    while next_n > 0:
        x *= next_n
        next_n -= 1
    return x

answer = 0
fctrls = [factorial(i) for i in range(0, 10)]
for i in range(3, 100000):
    # I stored all the factorials above. and then arbitrarily chose the range of 100,000
    s = str(i)
    temp_sum = 0
    for j in s:
        j = int(j)
       temp_sum += fctrls[j]
    if i == temp_sum:
        answer += temp_sum
else:
    print(answer)

print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
40730
finished in: 0.9230203109070632 seconds
```
