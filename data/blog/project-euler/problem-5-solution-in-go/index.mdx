## The Problem States

```text
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
```

## My Solution

I wanted to try doing this with a recursive function because I haven't written many in any language. What I wrote does this:

1. Create a loop through numbers, that starts at 20 and increments by 20 on each iteration.
2. Check each number to see if it is divisible by 19, if so check by 18, if so check by 17, if so...
3. Once the "divisibility check" reaches 1, I know I have a number divisible by all the integers from 1-20
4. Exit the program

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func recursive(num int, div int) bool {

    if div == 1 {
        // If the number to divide by reaches all the way to 1 then it is the answer
        fmt.Println(num)
        return true
    }
    switch num % div {
    // If there is no remainder in this division, can try the same function with div-1
    case 0:
        return recursive(num, div-1)
    default:
        return false
    }
    // Compiler complains if there is no default return
    return false
}

func main() {
    // Create a loop that increments by 20 indefinitely until condition is true and program exits
    for i := 20; ; i += 20 {
        // Can start at 19 because by definition it will be divisible by 20
        if recursive(i, 19) {
            os.Exit(0)
        }
    }
}
```

## The Output:

```
232792560
```
