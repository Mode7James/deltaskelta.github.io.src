## The Problem States

A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example,
the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be <M i="1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28" />, which means that 28 is a
perfect number.

A number <M i="n" /> is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than <M i="n" />
and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds <M i="n" />.

As 12 is the smallest abundant number, <M i="1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16" />, the smallest number that can be
written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater
than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further
by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant
numbers is less than this limit.

Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.

## My Solution

I wasn't able to get this as fast as I would have liked, but I was able to speed up my first solution by a factor of
10. I have no clue how to get thsi fast and it is solving in about 20-30 seconds so I am happy with that. I made an
efficient factoring function a few problems ago so I will use that to get all the factors, and a for loop to sum them
and find the abundant ones.

The hard part is taking the abundant numbers, summing all combinations and then finding which numbers under 28124
cannot be written as a sum. for this, I decided to use a sieve like I did for the prime numbers a few problems ago. I'
ll make a list of 28124 'false' and then change them to true if their index falls on one of the numbers that can be
written as a sum of two abundant numbers. Hopefully using a sieve(?) like this will be quicker than appending all of
those numbers to lists and whatnot.

## The Previously Written Function

```python
#Returns all of the factors of a number, the last factor is the number
def all_factors(x):
    #look for factors under the square root of x and add them only if x % factor == 0
    factors = []
    root = int((x ** .5) + 1)
    divisors = [i for i in range(1, root)]
    for i in divisors:
        j = x / i
        if x % i == 0 and x % j == 0 and j != i:
            factors.append(i)
            factors.append(int(j))
        elif j == i:
            factors.append(i)
    factors.sort()
    return factors

from aFormulas import *
import time
start_time = time.clock()

limit = 28124
abundant_sieve = [False] * limit
for i in range(1, limit):
    #abundant_sieve will be turned 'true' for abundant numbers according to index
    x = all_factors(i)
    factor_sum = sum(x[0:len(x) - 1])
    if factor_sum > x[len(x) - 1]:
        abundant_sieve[i] = True

sieve = [False] * limit
for i in range(0, limit):
    # This sieve is for abundants which can be written as the sum of two abundants.
    # I run through abundant_sieve until I hit a true
    if abundant_sieve[i]:
        for j in range(i, limit):
            # I then go through again, from i-limit and when I hit true it will add them
            if abundant_sieve[j]:
                s = i + j
            if s < limit:
                sieve[s] = True
            else:
                #Once the sum reaches over the limit, I know all consecutive sums will be higher than the limit as well. In this case I can break the loop and move to the next i.
                break

f_sum = 0
for i in range(0, limit):
    # I now have a list of true and falses, where the trues are at the index where there is a number which can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.
    # All I need to do is add the falses.
    if not sieve[i]:
    f_sum += i

print('the answer is:', f_sum)
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
the answer is: 4179871
finished in: 32.1900165451545 seconds
```
