## The Problem States

The decimal number, <M i="585 = 1001001001_2" /> (binary), is palindromic in both bases. Find the sum of all numbers,
less than one million, which are palindromic in base 10 and base 2. (Please note that the palindromic number, in
either base, may not include leading zeros.)

## My Solution

This was pretty easy, I had already made a simple function to check to see if numbers are palindromes in problem 4 so
I just used that to make a list of all palindromes under 1,000,000 and then iterated through it making it a binary
number and then taking the proper part of the binary number (because python returns it as a string '0b10010010') and
checking to see if the integer of the binary string is palindromes as well. If it is, the original i is added to the sum.

```python
import time
from aFormulas import arePalindrome
start_time = time.clock()

palindromes = [i for i in range(1, 1000000) if arePalindrome(i)]

answer = 0
for i in palindromes:
    binary = bin(i)
    binary = binary[2:]
    if arePalindrome(int(binary)):
        answer += i

print(answer)
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
872187
finished in: 2.0263644947418116 seconds
```
