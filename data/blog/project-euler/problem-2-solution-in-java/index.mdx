## The Problem States

```text
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the
first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-
valued terms.
```

## My Solution

I made a pretty straightforward solution here that I have done in other languages. Starting at `0` and `1` I go
through the process of deriving the fibonacci numbers and then if they are evenly divisible by two I add them to the
final sum. When the function reached the `stop` point which is an argument into the function, I return the final sum
value.

Programming in Java feels a lot like javascript and C at this point I haven't ran into anything that is new or hard
to grasp yet.

```java
public class euler2 {

  public static int make_fib(int stop) {
    int previous = 0;
    int current = 1;
    int sum = 0;
    while ( current < stop ) {
      int new_term = current + previous;
      if ( new_term % 2 == 0 ) {
        sum += new_term;
      }
      previous = current;
      current = new_term;
    }
    return sum;
  }

  public static void main (String[] args){
    int answer = make_fib(4000000);
    System.out.println("The answer is: " + answer);
  }
}
```

## The Output
