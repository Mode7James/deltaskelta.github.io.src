## The Problem States

```text
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10 001st prime number?
```

## My Solution

I wanted to implement a [prime sieve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) instead of just making a
prime function which I have written in another problem. The problem with doing it this way is that I have to give the
list an upper limit and I cannot start with just any number so I would have to take a wild guess the first time, and
when a solution appears I can go back and refactor my code to run faster with a lower "upper" limit.

This solution makes an array of `1,000,000` boolean false values. I then set the first and second one
(equal to the values `0` and `1`) to `true` to indicate that they are not prime numbers. It then iterates through the
list until it find a `false` value which indicates that number is prime. After the value is found, it iterates
through the list, turning every multiple of the prime number into a `true` value indicating that it is not prime.
There is a prime counter that increments every time a `false` value is found, when that reaches `10,000` I call `os.Exit()`

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"
)

func main() {
  var sieve [1000000]bool
  sieve[0], sieve[1] = true, true
  primes := 0
  for i := 2; i < len(sieve); i++ {
    if !sieve[i] {
      primes += 1
      for j := i; j < len(sieve); j += i{
        sieve[j] = true
      }
      if primes == 10001 {
        fmt.Printf("prime 10001 is: %d\n", i)
        os.Exit(0)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## The Output

```text
prime 10001 is: 104743
```
