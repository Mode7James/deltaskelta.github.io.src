## The Problem States

A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to
10 are given:

$ 1/2=0.5, 1/2=0.(3), 1/4=0.25, 1/5=0.2, 1/6=0.1(6), 1/7=0.(142857), 1/8=0.125, 1/9=0.(1), 1/10=0.1 $

Where $ 0.1(6) $ means $ 0.166666... $, and has a 1-digit recurring cycle.
It can be seen that $ \frac{1}{7} $ has a 6-digit recurring cycle. Find the value of $ d < 1000 $
for which $ \frac{1}{d} $ contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.

## My Solution

Thinking about repeating decimals, I can see that what makes things repeat is having the same remainder. for instance
take $ \frac{1}{3} $ as an example

- $ 3\overline{)1} $ doesn't work, so we move the decimal over one place
- $ 3\overline{)10} $ 3 goes into 10 three times, so we multiply $ 3x3 $ and we are left with a
remainder of one, move over one decimal
- It repeats forever because the remainder will always be one and nothing else.

For the case of $ \frac{1}{7} $

- $ \stackrel{0.142857}{7\overline{)1.00000}} $ each step in this division generates a remainder
- the set of remainders is $ 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 3... $
- once a remainder is repeated, we can be sure that the sequence will regenerate forever

Since the remainder was finally repeated there, it can be safely assumed that all the rest of the digits will repeat
in just the same way.

All I have to do is write a function that will do this for me and do it for all the numbers between 0 and 1000 and
find the largest one.

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

#counts dividing of digits to find the longest repeating remainder
def count_decimal_repeats(a, b):
    #A is the numerator, b is the denominator. r_list is a list of remainders, once it find a remainder that
    #has already been found before, it is sure to repeat the sequence. Returns the length of the remainder list
    r_list = []
    test = (a % b) * 10
    while test not in r_list:
        r_list.append(test)
        test = (test % b) * 10
    return len(r_list)

#creating the list of numbers that I will use to
r = [i for i in range(1, 1000)]

plength = []
for i in range(1, 1000):
    plength.append(count_decimal_repeats(1, i))

print('repeats:', max(plength), 'the fraction is:', '1 /', r[plength.index(max(plength))])
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
repeats: 982 the fraction is: 1 / 983
finished in: 1.2764464822623884 seconds
```
