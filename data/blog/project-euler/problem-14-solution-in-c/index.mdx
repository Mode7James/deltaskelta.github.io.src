## The Problem States

```text
The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

n → n/2 (n is even)
n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)

Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:

13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.

Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.
```

## My Solution

The algorithm to run the sequence was easy enough to write by itself. I could probably do a few optimizations on
which numbers to cut out o the process in the beginning, but I didn't know how to go about doing it without possibly
eliminating a number that could be the answer so I just ran them all to see what would happen

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <time.h>

long collatz(long num)
{	//This function is to run a collatz sequence and return the number of iterations
  int count = 1;
  while ( num > 1 ) {
    if ( num % 2 == 0 ) {
      num /= 2;
    } else {
      num = num * 3 + 1;
    }
    count += 1;
  }
  return(count);
}


int main ()
{
  clock_t start = clock();
  long max, answer = 0;
  for ( long i = 0; i < 1000000; i++ ) {
    long seq = collatz(i);
    if ( seq > max ) {
      max = seq;
      answer = i;
    }
  }
  printf("\nThe answer is:%ld\n", answer);

  clock_t end = clock();
    double time_elapsed_in_seconds = (end - start)/(double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
    printf("Finished in %f seconds.\n", time_elapsed_in_seconds);
}
```

## The Output

```text
The answer is:837799
Finished in 3.311148 seconds.
```
