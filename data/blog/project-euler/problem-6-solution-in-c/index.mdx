## The Problem States

```text
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
```

## My Solution

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <time.h>

int main ()
{
    clock_t start = clock();

    int sumSq = 0;
    int sqSum = 0;
    for (int x = 1; x <= 100; x ++){
        sumSq += x * x;
        sqSum += x;
    }
    sqSum *= sqSum;

    int answer = sqSum - sumSq;
    printf("The answer is: %d\n", answer);

    clock_t end = clock();
        double time_elapsed_in_seconds = (end - start)/(double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
        printf("Finished in %f seconds.\n", time_elapsed_in_seconds);
}
```

## The Output

```text
The answer is: 25164150
Finished in 0.000048 seconds.
```

This one is pretty easy and self-explanatory.
