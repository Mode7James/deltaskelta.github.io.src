## The Problem States

We shall say that an `n-digit` number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to `n` exactly once. For
example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is also prime.

What is the largest `n-digit` pandigital prime that exists?

## My Solution

I had no idea where to begin on this one. I started experimenting with making all the permutations of the numbers and
realized that there were way too many for that. I then moved onto making a sieve of Eratosthenes, but then realized
that the list 987654321 of [False] tags was enough to seize up all the memory in my computer.

I then came across divisibility rules which led me in the right direction. It turns out that if you add up every
digit of a number, if the sum is divisible by three, then the number will be divisible by three. Since every n digit
number will be made up of the numbers 1-n somehow, then I can just add up the digits 1-n and find the largest number
of digits not divisible by three.  I thought that would be a good starting point, and if I didn't find the right
answer then I would try something else. It turns out that a 7 digit pandigital number <M i="(7+6+5+4+3+2+1)" />
is the largest set that isn't divisible by three. I modified my previously written pandigital number function and
used that along with my prime number check function to just run through numbers systematically.

## The Code

```python
def is_prime(x):

    '''Checks for primality of x'''
    
    if x < 0:
        x *= -1

    div_by = [i for i in range(2, int(x ** 0.5) + 1)]

    for i in div_by:
        if x % i == 0:
            break
    else:
        return True

def pan_digit_chk(x, digits):

    '''Checks to see if a number is pan-digital 1-9, it will return false
       if the x includes 0 or numbers like (1245) it needs to include all
       digits from 1 to the length'''
    
    s = [True] * digits
    digits = [i for i in range(1, digits + 1)]
    x = str(x)

    if len(x) < digits[-1]:
        # Your number is incorrect, it needs to contain all the digits 1-n
        return False

    for i in range(len(x)):
        check = int(x[i])
        try:
            if s[check - 1]:
                s[check - 1] = False

            else:
                return False

        except IndexError:
            # You must supply a number that is digits 1-n > 124 is not valid
            # > 123 is valid.')
            return False
   
    return True

####This is where my solution actually begins-----------------------------------
start = 7654321

go = True
while go:
    if pan_digit_chk(start, 7):
        if is_prime(start):
            print start
            break
    start -= 2
    if len(str(start)) < 7:
        print 'end'
        break
```

## The Output

This finished pretty quickly mostly due to narrowing down the solution by math theory rather than programming
wits.
