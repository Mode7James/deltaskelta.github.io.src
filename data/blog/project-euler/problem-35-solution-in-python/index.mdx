## The Problem States

```text
The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves
prime. There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97. How many
circular primes are there below one million?
```

## My Solution

I had a hell of a time figuring this out because I initially thought that taking all the permutations of the digits
would be the best way. I was using functions from itertools to write my own function that would return all the
permutations. The problem was that I was not supposed to do that. The problem says to take all the rotations of the
digits, meaning just shift the first digit to the end and then do that again and again until all rotations have been
seen.

It was pretty easy after I did that and I managed to make it pretty fast as well. I made a simple function to rotate
the digits, it returns a list of all rotations. Then I used the sieve of Eratosthenes from the earlier problem to
quickly calculate and store all the prime numbers under one million.

I then made an inner loop to check and see if all the numbers in the rotation list were indeed stored as 'True' or
prime in my sieve.

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

#takes x and returns a list of all digit rotations
def rotate_digits(x):
    y = str(x)
    rotations = []
    for i in y:
        y = y[1:] + y[0]
        if y[0] != '0':
            rotations.append(int(y))
    return rotations

# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - This section is the sieve previously made
limit = 1000000
primes = []
sieve = [True] * limit

for i in range(2, limit):
    if sieve[i]:
        primes.append(i)
        for j in range(i + i, limit, i):
            sieve[j] = False

# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - This section checks to see if all rotations are prime
c_primes = []
for i in primes:
    rotations = rotate_digits(i)
    for j in rotations:
        # If the sieve shows 'False' (not prime) then it will break right there
        if not sieve[j]:
            break
    else:
        # If it reaches the end of the loop naturally, it will append i as a circular prime
        c_primes.append(i)
else:
    print('there are:', len(c_primes), 'circular primes, they are:', c_primes)

print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
there are: 55 circular primes, they are: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, 97, 113, 131, 197, 199, 311, 337, 373, 719, 733, 919, 971, 991, 1193, 1931, 3119, 3779, 7793, 7937, 9311, 9377, 11939, 19391, 19937, 37199, 39119, 71993, 91193, 93719, 93911, 99371, 193939, 199933, 319993, 331999, 391939, 393919, 919393, 933199, 939193, 939391, 993319, 999331]
