## The Problem States

```text
The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

n → n/2 (n is even)
n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)

Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.

Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.
```

## My Solution

This took me quite a while to figure out. I had a solution that did a brute force method that took 220 seconds to
complete. While thinking through the code, I thought it would be much better to store some of the sequence values,
that way if the function encountered that value later in the range/sequencing somewhere, it could just pull from the
already known values and add it to the sequence.

The solution I came up with is below, note that I am only caching the values once they are found at the end of the
sequence. I am still doing many inefficient calculations because I am not remembering the values of sometimes when it
goes above the starting number. Those numbers are definitely encountered later in the sequence and I could save much
more time by doing that, but I am happy with this for now.

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

#My goal here and now is to cache some of the known lengths so that if a number reaches a known length, it will
#just add to the current loop and be done, c_length is my length cache. Big is the variable where I will store the
#winner
limit = 10000
c_length = [0] * limit
big = [0, 0]
for i in range(1, limit):
    seq = 1
     j = i
    while j > 1:
    #The try loop is here to deal with the inevitable error of when the number goes above the limit during the cycle and thus our of the index range
        try:
            #This is the shortcut that saves time. if the index of the current process has already been cached, then it will just add the already known sequence - 1. It also makes j = 1 so the while loop will break next time around
            if c_length[j] > 1:
            seq += c_length[j] - 1
            j = 1
        #When it goes out of range, and throws an error, this loop will run and pass.
        except IndexError:
            pass
        #Once it gets here, if j is equal to 1 it will pass, it would only be one here it it took the shortcut
        if j == 1:
            pass
        elif j % 2 == 0:
            j = int(j / 2)
            seq += 1
        else:
            j = int((j * 3) + 1)
            seq += 1
    else:
        c_length[i] = seq
        if seq > big[1]:
        big[0], big[1] = i, seq

print()
print('the number[0] that gave the longest sequence[1] is:', big)
print()
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

It's not perfect, but I was able to speed up the result over ten times of the brute force solution

```text
the number[0] that gave the longest sequence[1] is: [837799, 525]

finished in: 19.168326171888364 seconds
```
