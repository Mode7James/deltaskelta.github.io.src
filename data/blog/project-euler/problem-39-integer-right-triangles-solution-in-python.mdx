## The Problem States

If `p` is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, <InlineMath math="a,b,c" /> there are
exactly three solutions for <InlineMath math="p = 120" />.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of <InlineMath math="p ≤ 1000" />, is the number of solutions maximised?

## My Solution

I had previously written a function for finding Pythagorean triplets given some criteria for the sum of them
(perimeter) this one is very similar so I decided to use that. I just had to modify the formula a little bit to get
rid of some redundant checking and I was able to speed it up by a lot. My first attempt came in around 400 seconds
and I got the wrong answer. I cut it down to 10 seconds and got the right answer.

My function takes the perimeter as input. The perimeter itself must be some kind of upper bound because if a
Pythagorean triplet sum is meant to equal it, then they obviously cannot be bigger than it. So I made a list of
numbers with the perimeter as the range.

In that list I started iterating through once. Then again, but this time in the slice from [a : perimeter - a]
because 1. the numbers obviously can't be equal and a and b can also not exceed the perimeter.

If we know a and b and we know the ultimate perimeter then we know c = perimeter - (a + b). If c^2 is less
than a^2 + b^2 then I can break. I don't have to waste my time checking any of the other c's that will also be out of
range.

Then finally, if a^2 + b^2 = c^2 I can add it to the list and then return the list when everything is done for that
particular perimeter. Repeat this for 1000 perimeters and I should have an answer.

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()


def pythagorean_if_perimeter(perimeter):
    '''Given a list of numbers, and a sum of sides, it will return all
        pythagorean triplets in the list that sum to the perimeter'''

possible_list = [i for i in range(1, perimeter)]
# Start with a list of component numbers that could equal the perimeter
pyth_tripsum_to_perimeter = [perimeter]  # including the perimeter by default for the output
for a in possible_list:
    for b in possible_list[a:perimeter - a]:
        # I put an upper limit on b to cut down on needlessly calculating
        # c and checking it for validity
        c = perimeter - (a + b)
        #print perimeter, a, b, c
        a2, b2, c2 = a ** 2, b ** 2, c ** 2
        if c2 < (a2 + b2):
            # Don't have to waste time
            break
        if a2 + b2 == c2:
            pyth_tripsum_to_perimeter.append([a, b, c])
return pyth_tripsum_to_perimeter

                
total_perimeters = [i for i in range(1, 1001)]
maximum = [1, [1, 1, 1]]

for i in total_perimeters:

        a = pythagorean_if_perimeter(i)
        if len(a) > len(maximum):
            maximum = a
            print a

print '\nfinished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds' 
```

## The Output

I could have made the answer just come out by itself, but I wanted to see everything as it was happening.
