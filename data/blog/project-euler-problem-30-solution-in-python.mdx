## The Problem States

> Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:
> 1634 = 1<sup>4</sup> + 6<sup>4</sup> + 3<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup>
> 8208 = 8<sup>4</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup> + 0<sup>4</sup> + 8<sup>4</sup>
> 9474 = 9<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup> + 7<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup>
> <p class="info">As 1 = 1<sup>4</sup> is not a sum it is not included.</p>
> The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.
>
> Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.

## My Solution

This problem was pretty hard to grasp because I couldn't first figure out what range of numbers to check. I could
obviously write something that ran through numbers, but where do I start? Where do I stop? After a little bit of
research I was able to figure out how to find an upper limit.

The biggest possible digit is `9` and I have to raise it to the 5th power.
This means that 9<sup>5</sup> + 9<sup>5</sup> would be a 2 digit number (`99`) when evaluating the single digit, and
a six digit number when evaluating 9<sup>5</sup> + 9<sup>5</sup> (`9^5 * 2`). the multiplier (2) represents the
number of digits. Therefore, I have to find an upper limit where the smallest `X` digit number is
larger than `9^5 * X`. It would be impossible to hit this amount of digits because the largest number I can construct
according to the problem (single digits raised to the fifth power and summed) is less digits than `X` digits.

When I use 7 as a multiplier, I get 9<sup>5</sup> * 7 = 413,343. The smallest 7 digit number is 1,000,000 and since
the single digits raised to the <sup>5</sup> will never quite catch up with the adding of digits (one line is linear,
the other is exponential), I can stop there. I made a graph for illustration below.

I was not sure how to go about eliminating the lower bound since 0^5 will be zero and 1^5 will be 1. If it turns out
to be a problem, I will go back and figure it out later.

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

final_sum = 0
for i in range(2, 354294):
    # I made a loop and then made i a string so I could re-iterate through it and do what I need
    x = str(i)
    temp_sum = 0
    for j in x:
        y = int(j) ** 5
        temp_sum += y
        if i == temp_sum:
            # If i is equal to the sum of the digits to the 5th power, add it to the final sum
            final_sum += i

print(final_sum)
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
443839
finished in: 4.913101301846909 seconds
```
