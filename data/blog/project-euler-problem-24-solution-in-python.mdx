## The Problem States

```text
A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits
1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order.
The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:

012   021   102   120   201   210

What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?
```

## My Solution

This one was pretty easy. I just needed to take the numbers, be they a list of numbers or strings and mash them up
every which way with a permutation and then find the 1,000,000th. I made a list of numbers as strings, user
'itertools' permutation function which I found online by searching, and then found the millionth. I wasn't sure if
they would be in order, but the website took my answer so I guess they are in order.

```python
import itertools
import time
start_time = time.clock()
# 1...make list of ints ------------------------------------------
strs = [str(i) for i in range(0, 10)]

# 2...make all permutations ------------------------------------
p = list(list(itertools.permutations(strs, 10)))

# 3...find the millionth ------------------------------------------
mil = ''.join(p[999999])

print(mil)
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
2783915460
finished in: 2.2940615767117434 seconds
```
