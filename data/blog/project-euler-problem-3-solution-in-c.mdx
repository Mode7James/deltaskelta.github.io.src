## The Problem States

```
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

```

## My Solution

I used the same method for this problem as I had in the past with Javascript and Python. My method was to remove
prime factors 1 by 1 starting with 2 and working my way up until the square root of the target number, which is
constantly getting smaller with every prime factor that is removed.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {
    long number;
    printf("What number would you like a list of prime factors for: ");
    scanf("%ld", &number);

    clock_t start = clock();
    //I have to make this one type long

    long divideBy = 2;
    while (divideBy <= sqrt(number) ) {
        while ( number % divideBy == 0 ) {
            printf("%ld, ", divideBy);
            number = number / divideBy;
        }
        divideBy++;
    }
    printf("%ld\n", number);
    clock_t end = clock();

    double time_elapsed_in_seconds = (end - start)/(double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
    printf("%f\n", time_elapsed_in_seconds);
}
```

## The Output

```
What number would you like a list of prime factors for: 600851475143
71, 839, 1471, 6857
0.000054
```
