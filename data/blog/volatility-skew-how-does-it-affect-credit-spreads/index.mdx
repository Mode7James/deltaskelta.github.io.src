I was watching a segment on TastyTrade [Market Measures - The Skewed Side](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/shows/market-measures/episodes/11473)

I thought about it for a few minutes and couldn't figure out why on earth that would be true. I knew it had something
to do with volatility skew because that was the title of the episode but I thought that even if you were selling a
put spread, you would be selling and buying a put, so the added IV in the put side would be cancelled out, right?

Below is a generic volatility skew graph. If you want to read about why the volatility is skewed like this, you can read
[wikipedia - volatility smile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_smile). They call it a volatility smile
because the REALLY far OTM calls also sometimes have a higher implied volatility as well. It is important to note
that this can look different in different underlyings at different times. It can bee equal on both ends (volatility
smile), or it can even be reversed (reverse skew).

When you sell a put credit spread, the further out of the money you go in the puts, the larger the IV becomes. This
would mean that your "risk defining" put that you buy further OTM would be a higher IV and thus more expensive than
your closer, and lower IV, put that you are selling. Conversely, when you sell a call credit spread, your "risk
defining," further OTM call, will be a lower IV and thus cheaper.

I have an illustration below. The red lines are short strikes, and the green lines are long strikes.

<Image1 align="right" width="40%" />

When you sell a put credit spread, you are selling something cheaper (red), and buying something more expensive
(green). When you sell a call credit spread, you are selling something more expensive (red), and buying something
cheaper (green).

This is so simple that I can't believe I had never realized this before. Sometimes the most obvious things are the
hardest to see.
