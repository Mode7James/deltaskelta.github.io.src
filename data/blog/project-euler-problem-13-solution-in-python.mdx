## The Problem States

```text
Work out the first ten digits of the sum of the following one-hundred 50-digit numbers.
```

[Euler 13 number](/media/posts/project-euler-problem-13-solution-in-python/Euler13number.txt) (I saved the number in this text file)

## My Solution

As usual with large things like this, I imported from a file just for the practice. After that I got everything into
a list and then added them together with a loop, and used floor division to get down to just the first ten digits.
Pretty straightforward.

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

the_number_file = open('Euler13number.txt', 'r')
raw_number = the_number_file.read()
the_number_file.close()

number_list = []
sindex = 0
findex = 51
#This loop is for taking the number file and getting it
for i in raw_number:
    #The ending index is 5151 because each time it adds there is one added (50 + 1)
    if findex == 5151:
        break
    else:
        number_list.append([raw_number[sindex:findex]])
        sindex += 51
        findex += 51

sum = 0
index =0
for i in number_list:
    #Index [0][0] is actually a long string right now, so when everything converts to integers, it only goes through this list 100 times
    sum += int(number_list[index][0])
    index += 1

print()
print('the sum is', sum)

# 10 9's is the highest 10 digit number possible, so floor divide until I get something lower than that
while sum > 9999999999:
 sum //= 10

print('the first ten digits are:', sum)
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
the sum is 5537376230390876637302048746832985971773659831892672
the first ten digits are: 5537376230
finished in: 0.006543661901963953 seconds
```
