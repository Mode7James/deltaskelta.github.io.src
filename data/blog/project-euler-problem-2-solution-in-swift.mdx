## The Problem States

```text
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the
first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the
even-valued terms.
```

## My Solution

```swift
func problem2() -> Int {
    //Setting the starting points and the sum counter
    var prev:Int = 1
    var current:Int = 2
    var sum = 0
    while current < 4000000 {
        if current % 2 == 0 {
            sum += current
        }
        let new = current + prev
        prev = current
        current = new
    }
    return sum
}

print(problem2())
```

## The Output

```text
"4613732\n"
```
