## The Problem States

```text
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10 001st prime number?
```

## My Solution

I think I should first make a function that efficiently finds prime numbers. Then I think I should make a while loop
to go through all numbers starting with 2, and stop when it reaches the 10,001st prime.

The most efficient way I could find of testing for primality is to make a list of divisors that goes up to and
includes the square root of x. any number above the square root of x that is an even divisor, must be multiplied by a
number below the square root of x to get x. Therefore I only need to check one side of the square root. In the case
of the square root being a decimal, I need to make it an int and add one to it to make sure it is included in the
list

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

#I break the loop if any of the numbers in div_by divide evenly, because that means x is not prime
#If it gets through all the numbers without having an even divisor, it returns true
def is_prime(x):
    div_by = [i for i in range(2, int(x ** 0.5) + 1)]
    for i in div_by:
        if x % i == 0:
            break
    else:
        return True

#For this bit I will start at 2, test for primality, and if it passes, I will append it to a list of primes and then check the next number.
#If the list reaches to 10,001 items I will break the loop
primes = []
test = 2
while True:
    if is_prime(test):
        primes.append(test)
    if len(primes) == 10001:
        break
    test += 1

#I printed part of this list to make sure it was working properly
print('prime list check:', primes[:10])
print('the number of primes found:', len(primes))
print('the 10001st prime:', primes[10000])

print()
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
prime list check: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
the number of primes found: 10001
the 10001st prime: 104743

finished in: 3.0949793153230822 seconds
```
