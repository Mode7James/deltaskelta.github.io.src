## The Problem States

```text
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10 001st prime number?
```

## My Solution

I first defined a function that would check for primality by seeing if a number less than or equal to the square root
of the target number is evenly divisible.

I went up to the square root because up to that point if a number has a factor that is evenly divisible below the
square root, then the other factor must be higher than the square root. So I really only have to check one of them.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <time.h>

int is_prime(int num)
{
  int sqrtDiv = lround(sqrt(num));
  while (sqrtDiv > 1) {
    if (num % sqrtDiv == 0) {
      return(0);
    } else {
      sqrtDiv--;
    }
  }
  return(1);
}

int main ()
{
  clock_t start = clock();

  int primes = 0;
  int numbers = 2;
  while (primes < 10001) {
    if (is_prime(numbers)) {
      primes+= 1;
    }
    numbers += 1;
  }
  //Had to do -1 at the end because I added one to numbers after every loop, even when it found the last prime.
  printf("The 10,001st prime number is: %d\n", numbers - 1);


  clock_t end = clock();
    double time_elapsed_in_seconds = (end - start)/(double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
    printf("Finished in %f seconds.\n", time_elapsed_in_seconds);
}
```

## The Output

```bash
The 10,001st prime number is: 104743
Finished in 0.060672 seconds.
```
