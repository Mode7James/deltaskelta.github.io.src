## The Problem States

> The fraction <sup>49</sup>/<sub>98</sub> is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to
> simplify it may incorrectly believe that<sup>49</sup>/<sub>98</sub> = <sup>4</sup>/<sub>8</sub>, which is correct, is
> obtained by cancelling the 9s.
>
> We shall consider fractions like, <sup>30</sup>/<sub>50</sub> = <sup>3</sup>/<sub>5</sub>, to be trivial examples.
>
> There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two
> digits in the numerator and denominator.
>
> If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.

## My Solution

I planned to first make a function that would do the simplifying error for me. I made both numerator and denominator
into strings and then iterated through them until I found a match. I then removed one instance of each with and then
returned the answer of their division for use later in the problem.

For the main loop, I iterated through all the two digit numbers below 1 (denominator greater than numerator). I took
the value of numer/denom and stored it as 'x'. If x turned out to be equal to the result of the above function that I
wrote, it continued onto the next line.

In the next section I took both the numerator and the denominator and floor divided them by 10, essentially removing
the last digit. I just couldn't think of any fraction that could be floor divided like this and still turn out to be
'non-trivial' according to the problem. I then printed out the numerator and denominator in a form I could use and
then multiplied each by a variable I had already set equal to 1.

I should now have the un-reduced numerator and denominator.  I wrote a function to reduce fractions which is
explained in the code and reduced it down. I had to use my previously written prime factor function so I have
included that here as well.

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()


#Creates the simplification error explained in the problem
def simplify_error(x, y):
    #Turns numerator and denominator into a string, and replaces them with nothing if they match, it returns the
    #division of the two if there are matching numbers and the denom is greater than 0
    sx, sy = str(x), str(y)
    for i in sx:
        for j in sy:
            if i == j:
                sx = sx.replace(i, '', 1)
                sy = sy.replace(j, '', 1)
                if int(sy) == 0:
                    return False
                return int(sx) / int(sy)
    return False


#Takes a fraction and reduces it down to its lowest terms where the numerator and denominator are above >= 1
def frac_reduce(numer, denom):
    #Makes a list of prime factors, and then iterates through it, stopping at the ones that are similar in both
    #lists. then it checks to make sure they are bigger than 1 and less than or equal to numerator and denominator
    #it then divided the numer and denom and returns the numer and denom when there are no matching prime factors
    #left.
    nf = prime_factors(numer)
    df = prime_factors(denom)
    for i in nf:
        if i in df and i > 1 and denom >= i <= numer:
            numer /= i
            denom /= i
    return[numer, denom]


#Returns the prime factors of x in a list
def prime_factors(x):
    factors = []
    div = 2
    while div ** 2 <= x:
        while x % div == 0:
            factors.append(div)
            x /= div
       div += 1
    if x > 1:
        factors.append(x)
    if len(factors) == 1:
        factors.append(1)
    return factors

numer = 1
denom = 1
for i in range(10, 100):
    for j in range(i + 1, 100):
        x = i / j
        y = simplify_error(i, j)
        if y and x == y:
            a, b = i // 10, j // 10
            if x != a / b:
                print(i, '/', j)
                numer *= i
                denom *= j

print('multiplying those fractions together gives:', numer, '/', denom)
print('and it reduces to:', frac_reduce(numer, denom))
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
16 / 64
19 / 95
26 / 65
49 / 98
multiplying those fractions together gives: 387296 / 38729600
and it reduces to: [1.0, 100.0]
finished in: 0.024990934158039862 seconds
