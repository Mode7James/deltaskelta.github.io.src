## The Problem States

```text
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
```

## My Solution

It is hard to switch my brain in `golang` mode after writing something else so this took me a deceivingly ling time
to write, but it is a pretty simple solution and it runs fast.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
)

func main() {
  num := 600851475143
  for x := 2; x < num; x++ {
    for num % x == 0 {
      fmt.Printf("%d ", x)
      num /= x
    }
  }
  fmt.Printf("%d\n", num)
}
```

## The Output

```text
71 839 1471 6857
```
