I wrote two solutions to the Go [Exercise: Images](https://tour.golang.org/methods/25) problem. One of them (the hard
way) does a full implementation of all the methods to the interface and the other (easy way) embeds anonymous types
to inherit from pre-existing image structs.

## The Hard Way:

<Image0 align="left" width="30%" />

This code produces the image to the left. I wrote most of it without looking at the current implementations of image
structs in the `image` package so it can probably be improved a lot.

`ShowImage` is going to use the image package and therefore my code much satisfy the [Image](https://golang.org/pkg/image/#Image)
interface within that package which states that an `Image` must have three methods `ColorModel()`, `Bounds()`, `At(x, y int)`.
So I will have to write custom methods that satisfy this and perform as expected.

## The `Image` Struct

This is a 3-dimensional slice that contains `x`-axis values, `y`-axis values, and `rgba` pixel values, the other
integers are `x` and `y` minimums and maximums.

## The `NewImage()` Method

This just initializes the slices and sets the values of the `x` and `y` minimums and maximums according to the input
it receives. It returns a pointer to an initialized, but empty (no pixel values) image.

## The `ColorModel()`, `At()`, and `Bounds()` Methods

The `ColorModel()` method just returns which color model the image will use. There are a lot of color models in the `
color` package such as `RGBA`, `CMYK`, etc... that are commonly used in most things. I saw no need in reinventing the
wheel so I just returned one of the pre-existing color models.

The `At()` method returns a color and takes an x and y pixel value as an input. In order to do this I need to
initialize a color with the RGBA values stored in the pixel at `x`, `y`.  these would be the indexes of 1-4 for `pixel[x][y]`.

The `Bounds()` method said it needed to return an `image.Rectangle` so I made one with the `x` and `y` minimums and
maximums and returned it.

## The `crazyColors()` Method

I need to have something that will generate `RGBA` values for every pixel so I wrote this method that loops through
and assigns values to the based on some random linear function for each value in `RGBA`.

```go
package main

import (
    "golang.org/x/tour/pic"
    "image"
    "image/color"
)

type Image struct{
    // one array for x value, one array for y values, array of integer for pixel RGBA values
    image_ [][][]uint8
    x0, y0, x1, y1 int
}

func (i *Image) NewImage(x, y int) *Image {
    image := make([][][]uint8, y)
    for i := 0; i < x; i++ {
        image[i] = make([][]uint8, x)
        for j := 0; j < y; j++ {
            image[i][j] = make([]uint8, 4)
        }
    }
    return &Image{image, 0, 0, x, y}
}

func (p *Image) ColorModel() color.Model { return color.RGBAModel }

func (p *Image) At(x, y int) color.Color {
    var c color.Color
    rgba := color.RGBA{
        p.image_[x][y][0],
        p.image_[x][y][1],
        p.image_[x][y][2],
        p.image_[x][y][3],
    }
    c = rgba
    return c
}

func (p *Image) Bounds() image.Rectangle {
    rectangle := image.Rect(p.x0, p.y0, p.x1, p.y1)
    return rectangle
}

func (p *Image) crazyColors() *Image {
    for i := 0; i < len(p.image_) - 1; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < len(p.image_[i]) - 1; j++ {
            p.image_[i][j][0] = uint8(i + j / 2)
            p.image_[i][j][1] = uint8(i + j * 2)
            p.image_[i][j][2] = uint8(i + j * 2)
            p.image_[i][j][3] = uint8(255)
        }
    }
    return p
}

func main() {
    var i *Image
    i = i.NewImage(255, 255)
    i.crazyColors()
    pic.ShowImage(i)
}
```

## The Easy Way:

<Image1 align="right" width="30%" />

This one was much easier since I am inheriting from the `image.RGBA` struct. All I have to do in this case is to make
a `crazyColors()` method to give the pixels `RGBA` values.

## The `crazyColors()` Method

In the `image.RGBA` struct [Go Docs](https://golang.org/pkg/image/#RGBA), there is only one array for pixel values.
One pixel is 4 consecutive integers, and they simulate having a 2-dimensional slice by also having a `stride` which
is the distance in bytes between vertically aligned pixels. This is a simpler way to store the information than what
I came up with.

So to give the values, I iterate through the slice by increments of 4 and assign values again based on some random
mathematical function I wrote on the spot. This code produces the image pictured to the right.

```go
package main

import (
    "golang.org/x/tour/pic"
    "image"
)

type Image struct{
    image.RGBA
}

func (i Image) crazyColors() Image {
    for p := 0; p < len(i.Pix); p += 4 {
        i.Pix[p] = uint8(p + p*2)
        i.Pix[p+1] = uint8(p + p*4)
        i.Pix[p+2] = uint8(p + p*6)
        i.Pix[p+3] = uint8(p + p*8)
    }
    return i
}

func main() {
    rect := image.Rect(0,0,255,255)
    m := Image{*image.NewRGBA(rect)}
    m.crazyColors()
    pic.ShowImage(&m)
}
```
