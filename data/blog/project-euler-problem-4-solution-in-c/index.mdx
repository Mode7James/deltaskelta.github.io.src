## The Problem States

```text
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
```

## My Solution

I had to do quite a bit of leg work and reading of manpages to make this work. I used some functions from the string.
h header file and I had to google some functions to reverse a string, which I couldn't believe was not part of the
string library.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <time.h>

//Function to reverse a string
char* reverse_string(char *str)
{
    char temp;
    size_t len = strlen(str) - 1;
    size_t i;
    size_t k = len;

    for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        temp = str[k];
        str[k] = str[i];
        str[i] = temp;
        k--;

        //As 2 characters are changing place for each cycle of the loop, only go through half of it.
        if (k == (len/2)) {
            break;
        }
    }
    return(str);
}


//Function to check if a number is a palindrome
int checkPalindrome( int number )
{
    //Change it to a string
    char str[15];
    sprintf(str, "%d", number);
    char str2[15];
    sprintf(str2, "%s", str);
    reverse_string(str);
    //Used strcmp from the string.h file, resturns 0 if they are the same, other random numbers if they are not the same.
    int same = strcmp(str, str2);
    if (same == 0) {
        return(1);
    } else {
        return(0);
    }
}


//Main loop, initializing i, j, and product to use later.
int i, j, product;
int main()
{
    clock_t start = clock();
    int highest = 0;
    for (i = 100; i < 1000; i++){
        for (j = 100; j < 1000; j++) {
            int product = i * j;
            if (checkPalindrome( product ) && (product > highest)) {
                highest = product;
            }
        }
    }
    printf("%d\n", highest);

    clock_t end = clock();

    double time_elapsed_in_seconds = (end - start)/(double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
    printf("Finished in %f seconds.\n", time_elapsed_in_seconds);
}
```

## The Output

```text
906609
Finished in 0.264757 seconds.
```

This was a pretty fast solution. C is really fast. My python solution took about .66 seconds when I reworked it to
work the same way as this one.
