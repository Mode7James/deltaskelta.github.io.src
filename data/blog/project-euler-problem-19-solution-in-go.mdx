## The Problem States

```text
You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

- 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
- Thirty days has September,
- April, June and November.
- All the rest have thirty-one,
- Saving February alone,
- Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
- And on leap years, twenty-nine.

A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.
How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
```

## My Solution

The [time library](https://golang.org/pkg/time) in go was really easy to work with in this problem. I called the
[date](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Date) function which takes `year, month, day, hour, minute, second` as input. The
only tricky part of using it is to notice that the `month` input is of type `Month` so I first had to instantiate a
variable of type `Month`.

After that I looped through each month of each year and tested to see if it was the first day of the week (on the `0`
day of the month) and added to the answer if it was.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "time"
)

func main() {
  answer := 0
  var month time.Month
  for year := 1901; year <= 2000; year++ {
    for month = 1; month <= 12; month++ {
      t := time.Date(year, month, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC)
      if t.Weekday() == time.Weekday(1) {
        answer += 1
      }
    }
  }
  fmt.Println(answer)
}
```

## The Output
