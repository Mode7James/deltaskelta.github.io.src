## The Problem States

```
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

a2 + b2 = c2
For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.
```

## My Solution

It was pretty simple to come up with a solution, I couldn't find a way to make it shorter easily so I just added the `
os.Exit(0)` to make the main function exit when it found the proper solution.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"
)

func main() {
  for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
    for j := i + 1; j < 1000; j++ {
      for k := j + 1; k < 1000; k ++ {
        if i*i + j*j == k*k {
          if i + j + k == 1000 {
            fmt.Println(i * j * k)
            os.Exit(0)
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## The Output

```bash
31875000
```
