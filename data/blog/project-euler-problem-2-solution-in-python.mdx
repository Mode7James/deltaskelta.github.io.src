## The Problem States

```text
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the
first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-
valued terms.
```

## My Solution

The first way I thought of doing this was to start a list of the fibonacci sequence and then make a for loop that
would add onto it and terminate when the numbers reached the 4,000,000 mark.

I would then make another for loop that added the numbers in the list together.

```python
#This is my beginning list of fibonacci numbers
fibonacci = [0, 1, 1, 2]

#The for loop that will add to the list of fib numbers
for numbers in fibonacci:
    if numbers > 1:
    nextNumber = fibonacci[fibonacci.index(numbers)] + fibonacci[fibonacci.index(numbers) - 1]
    if nextNumber > 4000000:
        break
    else:
        fibonacci.extend([nextNumber])

#Printing the list to make sure everything came out ok
print(fibonacci)

#Starting the loop that will add the numbers if they are even
fibonacciSum = 0
for numbers in fibonacci:
   if numbers % 2 == 0:
   fibonacciSum += numbers

#Printing the final answer
print('The sum of all the even fibonacci numbers under 4,000,000 is:', fibonacciSum)
```

## The Output

```text
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 121393, 196418, 317811, 514229, 832040, 1346269, 2178309, 3524578]
The sum of all the even fibonacci numbers under 4,000,000 is: 4613732
```
