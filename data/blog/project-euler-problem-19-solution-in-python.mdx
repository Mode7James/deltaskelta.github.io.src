## The Problem States

```text
You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

* 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
* Thirty days has September, April, June and November.
  All the rest have thirty-one,
  Saving February alone,
  Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
  And on leap years, twenty-nine.

A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
```

## My Solution

I plan to define the months, weekdays, and years/leap years and then iterate through them logically to build all the
dates in a list [1901, month, 1, day, 1, tue], [1901, month, 1, day, 2, wed]...

I could eliminate caching the dates to save memory, but I am not going to worry about that at this time. I want
everything there, so if I get a wrong answer I can go look at the dates it is creating. If it is too slow, or I need
to speed it up I can always go back and speed it up.

I commented the code pretty thoroughly so it should all make sense if you read through it.

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

#I first made lists of all the possible amounts of days in a month and put them here, I then defined each month as a
#list of days, and then defined the two types of years in terms of the months. It ends with a list months containing
#lists of days
thirtyone = [i for i in range(1, 32)]
thirty = [i for i in range(1, 31)]
twentyeight = [i for i in range(1, 29)]
twentynine = [i for i in range(1, 30)]

jan = thirtyone
feb = twentyeight
mar = thirtyone
apr = thirty
may = thirtyone
jun = thirty
jul = thirtyone
aug = thirtyone
sep = thirty
oct = thirtyone
nov = thirty
dec = thirtyone
febleap = twentynine

yearraw = [jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec]
leapyear = [jan, febleap, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec]

#I then defined the possible weekdays
weekdays = ['sun', 'mon', 'tue', 'wed', 'thu', 'fri', 'sat']

#I made this empty list so I could have a place to put everything. I aimed to have a list of lists with something like
#dates = [[year, month, day, weekday], [year month day weekday]] that way I can search the list to see how
#many times things match up certain ways
dates = []

#Defined the start year, start month index, starting day index, which will both be first month and first day
#The starting year was 1901 and the first day was a tuesday so I also included the index of the name of the day
n_year = 1901
monthcount = 0
daycount = 0
index_d = 2
while n_year <= 2000:
    #if the year is a century and divisible by 400 it will be leapyear
    if n_year % 100 == 0 and n_year % 400 == 0:
        year = leapyear
        # if it is divisible by 4 it will be a leapyear
    elif n_year % 4 == 0:
        year = leapyear
    #If not any of the above it will be a regular year
    else:
        year = yearraw
    #This is my loop, taking the months in year and the days in the months. I originally had it as month in year>
    #Day in year but that looped around the other way going jan1 feb1...dec1 jan1, etc.
    for month in year:
        for day in month:
            #Appending to my list of dates
            dates.append([n_year, 'month', monthcount + 1, 'day', year[monthcount][daycount], weekdays[index_d]])
            daycount += 1
            index_d += 1
            #If the days reach the end of the list, it resets
            if index_d == 7:
                index_d = 0
            #If the dates in the month reach the end of the month, it resets
            if daycount == len(month):
                daycount = 0
                monthcount += 1
           #If the month is the 12th month, it resets
           if monthcount == 12:
                monthcount = 0
                n_year += 1
 else:
     #printed this to make sure everything came out ok
     print(dates[:5])

#My final for loop to count the number of sundays that are also the first day of the month
count = 0
for i in dates:
    if i[4] == 1 and i[5] == 'sun':
    count += 1

print('there are', count, 'sundays')
print()
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
[[1901, 'month', 1, 'day', 1, 'tue'], [1901, 'month', 1, 'day', 2, 'wed'], [1901, 'month', 1, 'day', 3, 'thu'], [1901, 'month', 1, 'day', 4, 'fri'], [1901, 'month', 1, 'day', 5, 'sat']]
there are 171 sundays
finished in: 0.17781323339240385 seconds
```
