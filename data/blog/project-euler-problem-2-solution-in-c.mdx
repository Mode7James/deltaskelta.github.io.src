## The Problem States

```
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the
first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-
valued terms.
```

## My Solution

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  int previous = 1;
  int current = 2;
  int sum = 0;

  while ( current < 4000000 ) {
    if ( current % 2 == 0 ) {
      sum = sum + current;
    }
    int new = current + previous;
    previous = current;
    current = new;
  }
  printf( "The sum of all the fibonacci numbers below 4,000,000 is %d", sum );
}
```

## The Output

```bash
The sum of all the fibonacci numbers below 4,000,000 is 4613732
```
