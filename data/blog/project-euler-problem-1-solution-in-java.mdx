## The Problem States

```text
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these
multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
```

## My Solution

It is pretty straight forward  mathematically. This is the first thing I have ever written in Java so I had to go
through some tutorials on how to compile everything. It was actually quite painless to get going right away so I was
psyched about that.

I just initialized `n` and `answer` variables and added a while loop with the condition that `n < 1000` and added `n`
to the answer if it was evenly divisible by 3 or 5.

```java
public class euler1 {
  public static void main (String[] args) {
    int n = 1;
    int answer = 0;
    while ( n < 1000 ) {
      if ( n % 3 == 0 || n % 5 == 0 ) {
        answer += n;
      }
    n++;
    }
  System.out.println("The answer is: " + answer);
  }
}
```

## The Output

The answer is: 4613732
```

I haven't started timing or importing anything yet, I wanted to make the first one as siple as possible.
