## The Problem States

```
Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are
exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?
```

- See the original problem [HERE](https://projecteuler.net/problem=15)

## My Solution

The easiest way to count the possible routes is to start at the top left corner of the box and add all the previous
ways to get to that point. For the first horizontal and vertical rows, there will only be one way to get there. After
that you can add the possible routes to the previous horizontal corner and the previous vertical corner together and
that will be the number of routes to the current corner.

If you look at the example from the [original problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=15) then the numbers would
look something like this...

```
0 1 1
1 2 3
1 3 6
```

So I just creates a two dimensional slice that could represent all of the corners on a 20x20 grid and added up the
number of ways to get to each corner until I reached the end.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
)

func main() {
  size := 21
  array := make([][]int, size)
  for i := 0; i < size; i++ {
    array[i] = make([]int , size)
    for j := 0; j < size; j++ {
      if i == 0 {
        array[i][j] = 1
      } else if j == 0 {
        array[i][j] = 1
      } else {
        array[i][j] = array[i-1][j] + array[i][j-1]
      }
    }
  }
  fmt.Println(array[size-1][size-1])
}
```

## The Output

```bash

```
