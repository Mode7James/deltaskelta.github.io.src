I had already done a ton of problems in Python, but I wanted to get the hang of writing Javascript so I decided to
try a few of these problems in Javascript. The only way I could see to actually run the Javascript was to save these
in an html file with a script tag and then load it into Chrome and right click > inspect element > console.

Its a pain in the ass to reload the code to run it every time, but it works.

## The Problem States

```text
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these
multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
```

## My Solution

Pretty easy, loop through all the numbers under 1000, push them to an array if they are divisible by 3 or 5. Then
loop through the array and add each number to the sum. Yeah, I could have condensed that more, but I didn't care all
that much.

## The Code

```javascript
var ansList = []

for (var i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0) {
    ansList.push(i)
    }
}

var len = ansList.length
var sum = 0
for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    sum += ansList[i]
}

console.log(sum)
```


## The Output

```text
233168
```
