For this problem, they are using directed graphs to simulate the time when it is easy to move a currency in one
direction but difficult to move it in the other direction. When trying to figure out the best path to take to increase
profits, it is enough to add the logarithms of the exchange rates together because using logarithms, the following is
true...

$$
  xy = 2^{log_2(x)}2^{\log_2(y)} = 2^{\log_2(x) + \log_2(y)}
$$

$$
  xy  \rightarrow \max \Leftrightarrow \log_2(x) + \log_2(y) \rightarrow \max
$$

This means that the larger the sum of the logarithms of `x` and `y` are, the larger the product will be, and the smaller
the sums, the smaller the product will be. This doesn't work without logarithms because in the case that the exchange
rate is always `1/2`, if we were to just sum the factors together, the factor would be constantly
increasing. $ \log_2(1/2) = -1 $ and so therefore adding the logarithms will give the same effect from the
increase as actually multiplying the numbers out. Concretely, if the exchange rate is `1 to 1` then the logarithm will
be `0` and if the exchange rate is greater/less than `0` the summand will be respectively greater/less than `0`.

$$
  4 * 1 * 1/2 = 2^1
$$

$$
  \log_2(4) + \log_2(1) + \log_2(1/2) = 2 + 0 + (-1) = 1
$$

$$
  \prod_{j=1}^k r_{j} \rightarrow \max \Leftrightarrow \sum_{j=1}^k \log(r_{j}) \rightarrow \max
$$

If we wanted to make it a minimization problem, we could just replace the $ \log(r_j) $ terms
with $ -\log(r_j) $, which would have the same intended effect.

## Bellman-Ford Algorithm

```text
Relax(u, v)
  if dist[v] > dist[u] + w(u, v):
    dist[v] <- dist[u] + w(u, v)
    prev[v] <- u

BellmanFord(G, S)
  {no negative weight cycles in G}
  for all u of V:
    dist[u] <- infinity
    prev[u] <- nil
  dist[S] <- 0
  repeat |V| - 1 times:
    for all (u, v) of E:
      Relax(u, v)
```

A graph contains a negative weight cycle only if the `|V|`th iteration of the `BellmanFord(G, S)` algorithm updates a
distance value.

## Finding Negative Cycles

- run `|V|` iterations of the `BellmanFord` algorithm, save the node `v` that was relaxed on the last iteration
- v is reachable from a negative cycle
- start from `x <- v` and follow the `prev[x]` links v times (which guarantees a cycle)
- save all of the values and find where one of them repeats

## Detecting Infinite Arbitrage

1. do `|V|` iterations of `BellmanFord`, save all nodes relaxed on the `V`th iteration -> set `A`.
2. put all nodes from `A` into queue `Q`
3. do breadth first search with `Q`, and find all nodes reachable from A

These nodes are the set of nodes for which there exists a possibility of infinite arbitrage. We still don't know how to
go about executing the arbitrage though because there is no indication of which edges are directed edges and where the
exact cycles lie.

## Reconstructing Infinite Arbitrage

1. during `BFS` remember the parent of each visited node
2. Reconstruct the path to `u` from some node `w` which was relaxed on iteration `V`
3. go back from `w` to find a negative cycle from which `w` is reachable
