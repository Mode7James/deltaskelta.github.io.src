Minimum spanning trees give a way to connect a set of nodes with the minimum amount of work required. It could be
something like a network of computers or a network of roads where each edge has a cost associated with it.

## Trees

- an undirected graph that is connected and acyclic
- a tree of `n` vertices has `n - 1` edges because it is acyclic
- any connected, undirected graph with <M i="|E| = |V| - 1" /> is a tree
- an undirected graph is a tree if there is a unique path between any pair of its vertices

## Kruskal's Algorithm

- repeatedly add the next lightest edge to set `X` if it doesn't produce a cycle
- at any point in time the set `X` is a collection of trees
- the next edge `e` connects two different trees <M i="T_1" /> and <M i="T_2" />
- the edge `e` is the lightest between <M i="T_1" /> and <M i="V - T_1" /> (the set of vertices minus `T1`), so adding
  `e` is a safe move (produces no cycles)
- use disjoint sets data structure
- at first, each vertex is in a different set
- each set is a connected component
- to check whether the current edge produces a cycle, check if the vertex on either end belongs to the same set
- <M i="O(|E|\log|V|)" />

```text
Kruskal(G)
  for all u of V:
    MakeSet(v)
  X <- empty set
  sort the edges E by weight
  for all {u, v} of E in non-decreasing weight order:
    if Find(u) != Find(v):
      add {u, v} to X
      Union(u, v)
  return X
```

## Prim's Algorithm

- repeatedly attach a new vertex to the current tree by the lightest edge
- this is very similar to Dijkstra's algorithm
- an array based implementation runs in <M i="O(|V|^2)" />
- a binary heap implementation (priority queue) runs in <M i="O(|E|\log|V|)" />


```text
Prim(G)
  for all u of V:
    cost[u] <- infinity, parent[u] <- nil
    pick any initial vertex u_0
    cost[u_0] <- 0
    PrtyQ <- MakeQueue(V) {priority is cost}
    while PrtyQ is not empty:
      v >- ExtractMin(PrtyQ)
      for all {v, z} of E:
        if z in PrtyQ and cost[z] > w(v, z):
          cost[z] <- w(v, z), parent[z] <- v
          ChangePriority(PrtyQ, z, cost[z])
```
