Any optimal path consists of subpaths which are also optimal. This is because if there was a path such
that <M i="A \to B \to C \to D" /> is the optimum path and there was a shorter path from <M i="B \to C" />,
then the <M i="A \to .. \to D" /> path would not be optimal.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

- Maintain a set of `R` vertices for which `dist` is already set correctly.
- The first vertex added to `R` is `S`.
- On each iteration, take a vertex outside of `R` and relax all of its outgoing edges.
- `ExtractMin` extracts the minimum distance node from the current node (starting with the starting point `S`)


```text
Dijkstra(G, S)
  for all u of V: {u = edges}
    dist[u] <- infinity, prev[u] <- nil
  dist[S] <- 0
  H <- MakeQueue(V) {dist-values as keys}
  while H is not empty:
    u <- ExtractMin(H)
    for all (u, v) of E:
      if dist[v] > dist[u] + w(u,v):
        dist[v] <- dist[u] + w(u,v)
        prev[v] <- u
        ChangePriority(H, v, dist[v])
```
