## Directed Acyclic Graphs

a directed acyclic graph is a graph that has no cycles. It can be linearly ordered from the first component to the last
component without seeing any component twice. In order to check if a graph is acyclic, we could follow the following
method that builds off of a depth first search.

1. go through each node in the graph
2. call an `isAcyclic` function for each node
3. set a boolean value for `visited` for node
4. set a boolean value for `checking` on the node
5. recursively call `isAcyclic` for the adjacent nodes
6. if `visited` and `checking` for a node in the recursive call, return true because a node was seen while exploring
   itself.
7. after finishing the recursive call, set `checking` for node to false
8. return false for node

## Strongly Connected Components

A strongly connected component is a set of vertices where there is a cycle that each vertex can be reached from the
other vertexes in the strongly connected component. A single vertex is a `SCC` and two vertexes where `v -> w` and `w ->
v` is also a `SCC`.

#### Naive Algorithm <M i="O(|V|^2 + |V||E|)" />

```text
EasySCC(G)
  run explore(v) to determine vertices reachable from v
  for each vertex v:
    find the u reachable from v that can also reach v
```

In a graph with strongly connected components, if the `SCC`'s are treated as nodes, the resulting graph is always going
to be a directed acyclic graph (`DAG`). If there was some cycle between `SCC`'s then the `SCC` group would actually be a larger
`SCC`.

in a `DAG`, if we find the sink node (or component) we can remove it and the previous component will be the new sink. In
this way, we can traverse the whole graph and remove all of the sinks until there is nothing left. The result will be
that we have a list of all of the `SCC`'s in the graph.

The vertex with the largest postorder number is in a source component. If the order of each edge is
reversed <M i="G_R" />, we could do the same operation which would give us the sink component of the original <M i="G" />.

Combining these three ideas together, we can find the `SCC`'s of a graph by using the following
algorithm <M i="O(|V| + |E|)" />

```text
SCCs(G)
  Run DFS(GReverse)
  for v of V in reverse postorder:
    if not visited(v):
      Explore(v)
      mark visited vertices as new SCC
```
