import { M } from '../../../../src/components/math';

The most direct route algorithm has many applications such as finding the best chain of airline flights, routing of
network packets on the internet, and finding the optimal route to take when doing currency exchange.

## Paths and Lengths

- The length of the path is the number of edges in the path <M i="L(D - E - S - A - B) = 4" />.
- The distance between two vertices in the length of the shortest path between them.
- In a directed graph, the distances must be <M i="\geq" /> the distances in an undirected graph.
- If there is no path to another node, the disance is <M i="\infty" />

## Breadth First Search

```text
BFS(G, S)
  for all u of V:
    dist[u] <-- infinity
  dist[S] <-- 0
  Q <-- {S} {q a queue containing only S}
  while Q is not empty:
    u <-- Dequeue(Q)
    for all (u, v) of E: {u = edge, v = vertex E = all edges of graph}
    if dist[v] = infinity
      Enqueue(Q, v)
      dist[v] <-- dist[u] + 1
```

- the runtime is <M i="O(|E| + |V|)" />.
- each vertex is enqueued only once
- each edge is examined once for direted graphs and twice for undirected graphs

## Shortest Path Tree

```text
BFS(G, S)
  for all u of V:
    dist[u] <-- infinity, prev[u] <-- nil
  dist[S] <-- 0
  Q <-- {S} {q a queue containing only S}
  while Q is not empty:
    u <-- Dequeue(Q)
    for all (u, v) of E: {u = edge, v = vertex E = all edges of graph}
    if dist[v] = infinity
      Enqueue(Q, v)
      dist[v] <-- dist[u] + 1, prev[v] <-- u
```

The only difference between BFS and BFS with the shortest path is that the shortest path tree also stores the depth of
the origin to the current node.

## Reconstructing the Shortest Path

In order to reconstruct the shortest path from `S` to some other node in the graph, we need to start at the end and
follow the edges of the shortest path tree back to the `S` node and then return the reverse of that order.

```text
result <- empty
while u != S:
  result.append(u)
  u <- prev[u]
return Reverse(result)
```
