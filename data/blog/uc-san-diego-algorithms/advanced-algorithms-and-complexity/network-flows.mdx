Roads or computer networks can be represented by a directed graph with

- each edge <M i="e" /> is assigned a positive real capacity <M i="C_e" />.
- one or more vertices is labelled as a source
- one or more vertices labelled as a sink
- a flow is an assignment of a real number <M i="f_e" /> to each edge <M i="e" /> so that for all <M i="e" /> it is true
  that <M i="0 \leq f_e < \leq C_e" /> for all <M i="v" /> that are not a source or a sink
- <M i="\sum_{\text{ e into v }} f_e = \sum_{\text{ e out of v }} f_e" />.


the size of a flow can be computed by...

<M b="
|f| := \sum_{\text{e out of a source}} f_e - \sum_{\text{e into a source}} f_e \\
|f| := \sum_{\text{e into a sink}} f_e - \sum_{\text{e out of a sink}} f_e
" />

## Calculating Maximum Flow Minimum Cut

A **Cut** is defined as a set of vertices of <M i="G" /> so that <M i="C" /> contains all sources of <M i="G" /> and no
sinks of <M i="G" />. The size of a cut is given by

<M b="|C| := \sum_{e out of C} C_e" />

This can be seen as the bottleneck of the network, because the total flow of the network must be less that it

<M b="|f| \leq |C|" />
<M b="\max_{flows f} |f| = \min_{suts C} |C|" />

```text
FordFulkerson(G)
  f <- 0
  repeat:
    find s - t path P in GResidual necessary edges
    if no path: return f
    flip each edge flow (forward and residual) on the s - t path
    calculate max flow f along the path
    f <- f + g
```

The runtime of this is <M i="O(|E||f|)" />, which is the number of eddges and the total flow. This can be slow
if <M i="|f|" /> is large  This algorithm says to find a `s - t` path in the `GResidual` graph but there may be many
valid paths and it may be prudent to use a depth first or another way to find them.

During the step where each edge is flipped along the `s-t` path, we need to flip an edge that was, flowing towards the
`t` so that forward flow is utilized and backwards flow through the residual graph is freed up. If there comes a time
where an `s-t` path is found that utilizes the residual flow, then it needs to be flipped back to free up forward flow
and push residual flow towards capacity. All residual flow should probably be at capacity to start with.

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm can also get stuck in situations where it has to iterate many times in order to arrive at
the end solution as noted
[here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-algorithms-and-complexity/lecture/zSB4s/slow-example).

## Bipartite Matching

The Ford Fulkerson algorithm can be used to bipartite matching for something like scheduling or matching people up `1 to
1` by having a list of possible matches and then adding a source and a sink node on either side of the maching pairs.
This way, maximum flow corresponds to the maximum matches, and the node edges correspond to which nodes get matched with
which in the middle of the `s-t` path.
