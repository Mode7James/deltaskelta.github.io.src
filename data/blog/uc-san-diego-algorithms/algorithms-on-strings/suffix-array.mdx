Suffix arrays store the starting positions of all possible suffixes of the string in alphabetical order, for example...

<M b="
  \begin{bmatrix}
    a & b & a & b & a & a & \$ \\
    \$ & 5 & 4 & 2 & 0 & 3 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \\
  \$ \; a\$ \; aa\$ \; abaa\$ \; ababaa\$ \; baa\$ \; babaa\$
" />

In order to constrct a suffix array, we can sort a list of all single characters and then add the next character and
resort the list until we have a list that is the full length of the string. We can then remove everything after the `$`
end symbol and we have a sorted list of all possible suffixes.

Below is an implementation of counting sort for making the sorted list of single character suffixes. in the `j` loop of
the algorithm, it is recording the end position in the ordered list of that character. In the second `i` loop, it is
going from the end position of the single character, and placing them all into the ordered list. The runtime of this
algorithm is <M i="O(|S| + |\Sigma|)" />, where <M i="\Sigma" /> is the alphabet.

```text
SortCharacters(S)
  order <- array of size |S|
  count <- zero array of size |alphabet|
  for i from 0 to |S| - 1:
    count[S[i]] <- count[S[i]] + 1
  for j from 1 to |alphabet|:
    count[j] <- count[j] + count[j - 1]
  for i from |S| - 1 down to 0:
    c <- S[i]
    count[c] <- count[c] - 1
    order[count[c]] <- i
  return order
```

## Equivalence Classes

partial cyclic shifts in the string can be equal to one another, so we would like to find all of those to reduce the
total number of shifts we have to check. Below is an example of making equivalnce classes for all of the matching
classes of single character cyclic shifts.

The **order** array contains the index in the original string of the sorted single character at that index. For example
index 0 in order show that index 0 of the sorted string is in position 6 in the original string.

The **class** array contains the class of the character at an index of the original string. For example, in the original
string, index 6 is `$` so then index 6 of the class array shows that `$` is assigned class 0.

<M b="
  S = ababaa\$ \\
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \$ & a & a & a & a & b & b \\
    6 & 0 & 2 & 4 & 5 & 1 & 3 \\
  \end{bmatrix} \\
  order = \begin{bmatrix} 6, & 0, & 2, & 4, & 5, & 1, & 3 \end{bmatrix} \\
  class = \begin{bmatrix} 1, & 2, & 1, & 2, & 1, & 1, & 0 \end{bmatrix} \\
" />

```text
ComputeCharacterClass(S, order)
  class <- array of size |S|
  class[order[0]] <- 0
  for i from 1 to |S| - 1: # starting from 1 to avoid $ character
    # if original string of this character is not the same as the previous, this
    # works because the order is already sorted by the character.
    if S[order[i]] != S[order[i - 1]]:
      class[order[i]] = class[order[i - 1]] + 1
    else:
      class[order[i]] = class[order[i - 1]]
  return class
```

## Doubling Cyclic Shifts

It may be necessary to increase the length of partial cyclic shifts, which can be done by starting with a sorted cyclic
shift array of size <M i="L" /> and adding the desired number of elements to the list from the original string. We can
then sort by the part that was added using count sort because count sort is **stable**, that is it will not change the
order of the sorted suffix, if the prefixes are the same.

This counting sort algorithm is sorting the eqivalence classes.

```text
SortDoubled(S, L, order, class)
  count <- zero array of size |S|
  newOrder <- array of size |S|
  for i from 0 to |S| - 1:
    count[class[i]] <- count[class[i]] + 1 # making a count of each classes occurences
  for j from 1 to |S| - 1:
    count[j] < count[j] + count[j - 1] # record the end position of each class (in newOrder)
  for i from |S| - 1 down to 0:
    start <- (order[i] - L + |S|) mod |S| # to get the starting position regardless of if it loops around to the end
    cl <- class[start] # get the class of the preceeding charater
    count[cl] <- count[cl] - 1 # decrement this class by 1
    newOrder[count[cl]] <- start
```

## Updating Classes

Now that we can increase and sort cyclic shifts of different lengths, we need to be able to update the equivalence
classes.

```text
UpdateClasses(newOrder, class, L)
  n <- |newOrder|
  newClass <- array of size n
  newClass[newOrder[0]] <- 0 # newOrder is still sorted with $ first
  for i from 1 to n - 1: # skipping the 0th one we just did
    # get the original classes of both sections of the cyclic shift, if they are both the same, then they can be the
    # same class
    cur <- newOrder[i], prev <- newOrder[i - 1]
    mid <- (cur + L), midPrev <- (prev + L) (mod n) # mod n to both to loop around if necessary
    if class[cur] != class[prev] or class[mid] != class[midPrev]:
      newClass[cur] <- newClass[prev] + 1
    else:
      newClass[cur] < newClass[prev]
  return newClass
```

## Building A Suffix Array

```text
BuildSuffixArray(S)
  order <- SortCharacters(S)
  class <- ComputeCharacterClass(S, order)
  L <- 1
  while L < |S|:
    order <- SortDoubled(S, L, order, class)
    class <- UpdateClasses(order, class, L)
    L <- 2L
  return order
```

Because each of the functions called runs in linear time and the <M i="L" /> doubles on every iteration of the while
loop, the runtime of this algorithm is <M i="O(|S| \log |S| + |\Sigma|)" />.

## Suffix Array and Suffix Tree

It is possible to take a suffix array and construct a suffix tree by finding the least common prefixes of each item in
the suffix array and then make a tree from that.
