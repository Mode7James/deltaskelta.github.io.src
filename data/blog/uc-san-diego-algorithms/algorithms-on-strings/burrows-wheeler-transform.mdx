import { M } from '../../../../src/components/math';

The Burrows-Wheeler transform is the last column of a sorted matrix of all of the rotations of a string with the `$`
viewed as the first in the sort order. for example, the string <M i="ABACDCB\$" /> would turn out to be...

<M b="
\begin{bmatrix}
 A & B & A & C & D & C & B & \$ \\
 \$ & A & B & A & C & D & C & B \\
 B & \$ & A & B & A & C & D & C \\
 C & B & \$ & A & B & A & C & D \\
 D & C & B & \$ & A & B & A & C \\
 C & D & C & B & \$ & A & B & A \\
 A & C & D & C & B & \$ & A & B \\
 B & A & C & D & C & B & \$ & A
\end{bmatrix}
\rightarrow
\begin{bmatrix}
 \$ & A & B & A & C & D & C & B \\
 A & B & A & C & D & C & B & \$ \\
 A & C & D & C & B & \$ & A & B \\
 B & \$ & A & B & A & C & D & C \\
 B & A & C & D & C & B & \$ & A \\
 C & B & \$ & A & B & A & C & D \\
 C & D & C & B & \$ & A & B & A \\
 D & C & B & \$ & A & B & A & C
\end{bmatrix}
\rightarrow B\$BCADAC
" />

From this transform text we can construct the matrix by taking the column and sorting it to get the first column. We can
then put the first column after the BW trasnform and sort it to get the first two columns. We can then repeat this
process until we have the original matrix again.

During the reconstruction we are sorting the text which takes <M i="O(|Text| \log |Text|)" /> to run. Sorting strings
with length <M i="|Text|" /> will take <M i="O(|text|^2 \log |Text|)" /> and since we are sorting by lengths ranging
from <M i="1 ... |Text|" /> then by using an infinite series sum we can arrive at the total sorting length of the
strings...

<M b="\sum_{k=1}^n k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \rightarrow |Text|(|Text| + 1) / 2" />

So then the running time would be evaluated as

<M b="O(|Text| \log |Text| \frac{|Text^2| + Text}{2}) \rightarrow O(|Text|^3 \log |Text|)" />

Reconstruction can be done qith a quicker algorithm by two special properties of the `Text` matrix

- the k-th occurence of symbol in the first column and the k-th occurence of symbol in the last column correspond to
the same position in the text.

This means that we can reconstruct the text in reverse by

1. sorting the BW trasnform to get the first column (from the last column which is the BW Transform)
2. starting at the `$` of the sorted column, we can follow it to the last column (because we know that in reverse, the
last column will be adjacent to the first column)
3. if the last column if the k-th occurence of the letter in the last column, follow it to the k-th occurence of the
letter in the first column.
4. The first column letter is now the next letter in the revered sequence, follow it to the last column and repeat this
process until the `$` is reached in the last column

<M b="
\text{First Column}
\begin{bmatrix}
\$ \\
A \\
A \\
A \\
G \\
G \\
G
\end{bmatrix}
\rarr
\text{ Burrows-Wheeler }
\begin{bmatrix}
A \\
G \\
G \\
G \\
A \\
A \\
\$
\end{bmatrix}
\rarr
GAGAGA\$
" />

The runtime of the reconstruction is <M i="O(|Text|)" />. This runtime is assuming that there is a lookup time
of <M i="O(1)" /> the <M i="i^{th}" /> occurence of the letter in the first and last column. This will need to be
constructed, but it should be doable in linear time as well.

## Pattern Matching With Burrows-Wheeler

> **Note:** be careful about which columns are first and last.

The `LastToFirst` argument is an array that references the index in the `LastColumn` to the index of the same character
in the `FirstColumn` so they can be easily looked up.

```text
BWMatching(FirstColumn, LastColumn, Pattern, LastToFirst)
  top <- 0
  bottom <- |LastColumn| - 1
  while top < bottom
    if Pattern is not empty
      symbol <- last letter in pattern
      remove last letter from pattern
      if positions from top to bottom in LastColumn contain symbol
        topIndex <- first position of symbol among position from top to bottom in LastColumn
        bottomIndex <- last position of symbol among position from top to bottom in LastColumn
        top <- LastToFirst(topIndex)
        bottom <- LastToFirst(bottomIndex)
      else
        return 0
    else
      return bottom - top + 1
```

The algorithm can be made faster by not having to scan through the entire last column on every iteration. The one above
has to scan the length of the column when it calculates the `topIndex` and `bottomIndex`.

- `FirstOccurence` is a reference to the index of the first occurence of the symbol
- `Count` is a hash table of arrays for all of the symbols in the text with the number of times the symbol appears in
  the `LastColumn` index before the current array index.

> **TODO:** write what the count array does once I implement it.

```text
BetterBWMatching(FirstOccurence, LastColumn, Pattern, Count)
  top <- 0
  bottom <0 |LastColumn| - 1
  while top <= bottom
    if pattern is not empty
      symbol <- last letter in pattern
      remove last letter from pattern
      top <- FirstOccurence(symbol) + Count[symbol](top, LastColumn)
      bottom <- FirsOccurence(symbol) + Count[symbol](bottom + 1, LastColumn) - 1
    else
      return bottom - top + 1
  return
```

## Suffix Arrays

**Suffix Arrays** hold the position of each suffix beginning a row.

This means that to get the suffix array we would have to make a BW Transform and then count the number of symbols after
the ending symbol. The resulting array shows the start point of each suffix (that goes until the end symbol).

<props.imgs.Img1 align="left" width="30%" />

Constructing the suffix array can be done quickly by getting the starting index (leaf values) from a suffix tree that
was discussed in the earlier lectures.

Once the suffix array is constructed, it can be used to match patterns in text by doing the first-last matching as
above, but also being able to figure out by the first column of the BW Transform combined with the info from the suffix
array, where the pattern starts in the original text.

## Approximate Pattern Matching

Approximate pattern matching can be accomplished by specifying the maximum possible number of mismatches and then
keeping track of hwo many there have been and going through the above stated matching procedures. This way, if we wish
to see how many matches there are with `x` mismatches, it can be done.
