A naive algorithm to find the number of matches of multiple strings in text would be to scan the text letter by letter
for each string pattern and count the number of matches. The running time of this algorithm would be upper bounded
by <M i="O(|Text| * \sum |pattern|)" />.

A quicker way to solve this would be to make one pass through the text and check each pattern with the patterns put into
a tree structure that branches out from the root node when there is a new pattern. The trie can be constructed from the
following algorithm.

```text
TrieConstruction(Patterns)
  Trie <- a graph with only a root node
  for string of Patterns:
    currentNode <- root
    for i <- 1 to |Pattern|:
      currentSymbol <- Pattern[i]
      if there is an outgoing edge from currentNode with label currentSymbol
        currentNode <- ending node of this edge
      else
        add a new node (newNode) to trie
        add a new edge from currentNode to newNode with label currentSymbol
        currentNode <- newNode
  return Trie
```

Patterns can then be matched by going through the text and matching by going down different paths in the trie.

```text
PrefixTrieMatching(Text, Trie)
  symbol <- first letter of Text
  v <- root of Trie
  while forever:
    if v is a leaf in trie:
      return the pattern spelled by the path from the root to v
    else if there is an edge (v, w) in Trie labeled by symbol
      symbol <- next letter of text
      v <- w
    else
      output "no matches found"
      return

TrieMatching(Text, Trie)
  while Text is nonempty
    PrefixTrieMatching(Text, Trie)
    remove first symbol from text
```

## Suffix Tries

This algorithm is fast, but uses a lot of memory because the entire text has to be loaded into memory which could be
huge when matching patterns in a genome. A suffix trie (of the text) could make this faster by making a tree from all of
the possible starting positions which counts all of the patterns like the image below.

The memory footprint of a suffix trie is <M i="O(|Text| * |Text - 1| /2)" />

In order to lower the memory requirement, we can compress the suffix tree leaves into a single node and only store the
start position and length which would give us enough information to reconstruct the suffix tree from the text.
