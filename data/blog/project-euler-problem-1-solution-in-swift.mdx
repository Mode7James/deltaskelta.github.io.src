## The Problem States

```text
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
```

## My Solution

```swift
var sum = 0
func problemOne() -> Int {
  for i in 1..<1000 {
    if i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0 {
        sum += i
    }
  }
  return sum
}

var x = problemOne()
print(x)
```

## The Output

```text
"233168\n"
```

Pretty easy, I had some trouble getting XCode to work properly and I actually hate the environment of it which is
surprising, but I guess I will have to deal with it.
