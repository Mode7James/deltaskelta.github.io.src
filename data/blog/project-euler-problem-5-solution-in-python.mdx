## The Problem States

```text
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
```

## My Solution

I think it would be best to have a list of possible divisors (1-20) and try dividing a number by all of them,
increasing the number upwards if there is a failure to evenly divide.

I know that each number should be divisible by 20, so that means I can increase the number by an increment of at
least 20 each time. I also know that I can eliminate 1 and Â 20 from my list of divisors since 2520 is divisible by 20
and I know that every increment will also be divisible by 20 and 1.

I want to start my divisibility test at 19 since I will get a lot of unneeded testing if I start at 2.

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

#Making the list of divisors and then reversing it to start with the largest number (19)
divisors = [i for i in range(2, 20)]
divisors = divisors[::-1]

#I decided to start the loop at 2520. I added the breaker variable to break the
#while loop when my condition is met
number = 2520
breaker = 1
while breaker == 1:
    for i in divisors:
        if number % i != 0:
            #I break here because it is pointless to continue if the number is not divisible by one of the divisors
            break
        elif number % i == 0 and i == 2:
            print('answer is:', number)
            breaker = 0
    number += 20

print()
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

answer is: 232792560

finished in: 11.46672106176495 seconds
```

I was brute-forcing it like that and it was taking some time (11 seconds) and then I had a thought. I thought that
the final number must be a multiple of all the prime numbers in the divisors since it is evenly divisible by all of
those numbers and since those numbers are not divisible by anything else. I started the variable 'number' at (19 * 17
* 13 * 11 * 7 * 5 * 3 * 2) and then increased it by that increment each time and I was able to speed up the problem
by a factor of 67,000
