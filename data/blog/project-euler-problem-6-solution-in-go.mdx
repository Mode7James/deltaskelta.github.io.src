## The Problem States

```text
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
```

## My Solution

To solve this I made two functions, one which would create all the squares of a sequence of numbers and add it to a
sum. The other function will sum all of the numbers in a sequence and then return the square of those. The functions
both take an input that is the upper limit. So if `10` was the input it would (`sum the squares` or `square the sums`)
of `[1, 2, 3, ... 10]`

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func sum_squares(nth int) int {
  // Nth is the upper limit of numbers to sum all squares
  sum := 0
  for i := 1; i <= nth ; i ++ {
    sum += i*i
  }
  return sum
}

func square_sum(nth int) int {
  // Nth is the upper limit of numbers to square the sum of
  sum := 0
  for i := 0; i <= nth; i++ {
    sum += i
  }
  // Returnging the sum squared
  return sum * sum
}

func main() {
  fmt.Printf("answer: %d\n",   square_sum(100) - sum_squares(100))
}
```
