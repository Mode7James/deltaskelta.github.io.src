If you have to spend any real time with a `BASH` prompt then you had better learn some of these shortcuts. They will
save you so much time in the long run! There are *TONS* of other commands as well but I find myself using the 10 on
this list the most.

*UPDATE: If you are on a Mac you can restore the ALT(option) key to its original function by going to edit > Use
Option as Meta Key. Without doing this, the ALT(option) key is replaced by the escape key*

#### CTRL + A

This will take you to the beginning of a line. Useful for when you are scrolling through your command history and you
realize you want to use the same argument as the command before but you just need to change something near the
beginning. Dont even think about touching the backspace button, just tap `CTRL + A` and go back to the beginning and
change the what you need, press `ENTER` and you are good to go.

### CTRL + E

This will take you to the end of a line. If you just edited another part of a command, but you need to add something
to the end of the argument, don't lay on the forward arrow and wait for the cursor to scroll to the end, use the hotkey...

### ALT + b  (WINDOWS)
### OPTION + ← (MAC)

This combination will scroll backwards one word (tap `←` or `b` multiple times to keep skipping words). If you are
dealing with a path (like `/home/user/path/to/a/file.txt`) then it will treat the slashes (and usually other
punctuation marks) as the beginning/end of a word object as well. So instead of holding the back arrow for 5 seconds
to change something in the middle of your command or args, you can make the cursor jump by word instead.....This one
is REALLY a timesaver.

### ALT + f (WINDOWS)
### OPTION + → (MAC)

If you can't already tell, this is pretty much the opposite of the previous command. This one makes the cursor jump
forward at by one word object which can really save some scroll time if you avoid using the forward arrow.

### CTRL + r

Launches a little prompt where you can type a unique part of some recent command. It will automatically complete the
command it thinks you want from history and then you just press enter to execute it. Really useful for when you know
your  command is in the history, you are too lazy to type it again, and you don't feel like hitting the up arrow 50
times to get to it.

There is another feature you can also search deeper with. For instance, if you knew your command included the
filename `foo.txt` and you did a `CTRL + r` and typed `foo.txt` in the prompt, it may bring up the command
`vim /path/to/the/file/foo.txt` when in reality you wanted to run the command
`less /path/to/the/file/foo.txt`. No worries just tap `CTRL + r` again and it will scroll through all the commands
that include the search term `foo.txt`. A real time saver...

### ALT + . (WINDOWS)
### ESC + . (MAC)

This combination will pull the last argument of the previous command in your history.

Say you just typed out something like `cat path/to/a/file/that/is/really/crazy/deep/in/dirs.conf` and next you want
to run `cp` `mv` `vi` on the file. Simply type `cp` and then tap `ALT ( or ESC ) + .` and you will instantly have the
long path added after `cp`.

### ALT + delete (WINDOWS)
### ESC + delete (MAC)

This combination will delete the word preceding the cursor. Really useful when you need it.

### ALT + d (WINDOWS)
### ESC + d (MAC)

This combination is the opposite of `ALT ( or ESC ) + delete`, it will delete the word after the cursor.

### TAB

The grand daddy of them all. If you don't already know this one then I don't know how you can survive on a *nix like
system. This will auto-complete the word you are typing based on what binaries are in your system path and what files
may be in the your current directory or the path you are typing (if you are in the middle of typing the path).

If you hit the tab button and nothing happens that is because it has tried to autocomplete, but has found that...

1.  Nothing matches ...or...
2. Multiple mathces

In this case double tap the `TAB` key. If there are no matches then nothing will happen. If there are multiple
matches it will show you a list of them. Simply type a few more characters until there are no more similar files,
paths, or binaries that match and hit `TAB` again and it will finish the word for you.

### CTRL + K

This one will clear the line after the cursor, great for when you need part of the command, but need to change a
path, or whatever may be on the end...
