## The Problem States

```text
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
```

## My Solution

I have the range number as an input and then I jut check if each descending number is divisible by the input. If it
is not, it will go to the else loop and add the input to the number.

It should fail pretty quickly (and get on solving the problem) for most numbers since there are not many numbers that
are divisible by 19

```swift
func p5(n:Int) -> Int {
    //takes in the number (range that is stated in problem 5
    var divisor = n
    var number = n

    //this loop goes through and tries all the divisors until it reaches 1, if an equal
    //division fails it just adds the top divisor (input) and starts again until it finds one that is
    //divisible by every number under the input
    while divisor > 1 {
        if number % divisor == 0 {
            divisor -= 1
            if divisor == 1 {
                break
            }
        } else {
            divisor = n
            number += n
        }
    }
    return number
}

var x = p5(20)
print (x)
```

## The Output

```text
232792560
```
