## The Problem States

```text
The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

Find the sum of all the primes below two million.
```

## My Solution

I had already defined a function to tell if a number was prime or not in [Problem 7](/post/project-euler-problem-7-
solution-in-swift) so I just used that to create  a simple loop here to add it to a sum if it is prime and below two
million.

```swift
import Foundation

public func problem10 () -> Int {
    var sum = 2
    for i in 2..<2000000 {
        if (is_prime(i)) {
            sum += i        }
    }
return(sum)
}
```

## The Output

```text
"142913828922\n"
```
