## The Problem States

```text
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

a2 + b2 = c2
For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.
```

## My Solution

At first I just attempted a brute-force solution but it was taking much too long (about 72 seconds). All of the
problems from the site are supposedly supposed to take less than a minute to crunch on the computer so that was not
good enough for me. I knew I had to eliminate some of the numbers in the loop so there were less permutations, but I
wasn't sure how to do it until I read the Wikipedia on [pythagorean
triples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple)Â and realized that the pattern will always be a &lt; b &lt; c.
I then added some to the b and c loops to reflect that and it cut the time down to about 30 seconds.

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

#The range for this problem
pyth_range = [i for i in range(1, 1000)]

#This function loops through the list 3 times, making sure a &lt; b &lt; c
def pythagorean(x):
    for a in x:
        for b in x[a - 1:]:
            for c in x[b - 1:]:
                if a + b + c == 1000 and a ** 2 + b ** 2 == c ** 2:
                    return [a, b, c, 'the product:', a * b * c]

print(pythagorean(pyth_range))
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
[200, 375, 425, 'the product:', 31875000]
finished in: 30.189189743958167 seconds
```
