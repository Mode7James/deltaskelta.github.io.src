## The Problem States

Consider all integer combinations of

<BlockMath math="a^{b} \; for \; 2 <= a <= 5 \; and \; 2<= b <= 5:" />
<BlockMath math="2^2=4, \; 2^3=8, \; 2^14=16, \; 2^5=32" />
<BlockMath math="3^2=9, \; 3^3=27, \; 3^4=81, \; 3^5=243" />
<BlockMath math="4^2=16, \; 4^3=64, \; 4^4=256, \; 4^5=1024" />
<BlockMath math="5^2=25, \; 5^3=125, \; 5^4=625, \; 5^5=3125" />

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of 15 distinct
terms: <InlineMath math="4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125" />

How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by <InlineMath math="a^b \; for \; 2 <= a <= 100 \; and \; 2<= b <= 100" />

## My Solution

I thought that there might be some efficient way to skip calculating numbers that will give the same result but I
decided to just try the obvious solution to see how long it would take. It ended up being extremely quick so I just
stuck with it.

Just two for loops multiplying all the combinations and appending them to a list. After that I eliminated any repeats.

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

seq = []
for a in range(2, 101):
    for b in range(2, 101):
        seq.append(a ** b)

seq2 = list(set(seq))
print(len(seq2))

print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
9183
finished in: 0.03235691691373213 seconds
```
