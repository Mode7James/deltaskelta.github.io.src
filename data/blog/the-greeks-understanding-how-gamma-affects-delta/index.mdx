For quite some time I thought I knew what Gamma was and I could explain it in theory, but while trying to figure out
how it really affected my positions I realized I couldn't exactly say. I knew how it could affect my positions but I
couldn't quantify it. I decided it was time to get down to it and really figure it out here.

Being the second derivative of price, Gamma will tell you how much your Delta is going to change when the underlying
price moves away from the current price. This is extremely helpful in deciding how much risk you currently have. You
could be deceived by having a small Delta but a huge Gamma, in which case your Delta may change by a lot with only a
small movement in price. There are tons of basic explanations of Gamma so I won't bother in going into it in detail
here, but I will talk about how to apply it in practice. You can read more about Gamma and basic greeks on
[Wikipedia - Greeks (finance)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_%28finance%29), or you can simply do a search that
will bring you to a whole lot of articles already written on the subject. This article will tell you how to interpret
Gamma numbers and apply them in real life.

## I'll make a few statements from the chart to make things a little more clear

1. Delta is most volatile (Gamma is highest[absolute value]) when an option is ATM, which means the Delta will be the
most unstable
2. As delta approaches 0 or 1 (Deep ITM or Deep OTM) Gamma becomes smaller, meaning Delta will be more stable
3. Gamma is always positive for a long option. You can see the long puts and calls are on the opposite side of the 0
line, but they are affected in exactly the same way by the always positive Gamma

## So, Why do long options have positive Gamma

Gamma will always be positive when talking about long options because it has a positive relationship with price. This
means that when price goes up, Gamma adds to delta. When price goes down, Gamma subtracts Delta. Look at the example
below.

```text
Long Option                    Delta          Gamma
SPY 192 Call (ATM)	           .42	         .08
SPY 192 Put (ATM)	          -.57	         .08
```

So if the price of SPY rises to 193, the Delta of the call will become approximately .50 (.42 + .08). If the price of
SPY falls to 191, the Delta of the call will become somewhere around .34 (.42 - .08). Notice that as price rises,
Gamma adds to Delta, and Delta approaches 1. As price falls, Gamma is subtracted from Delta, and Delta approaches 0.

If the price of SPY rises to 193, the put Delta will become approximately -.49 (-.57 + .08). If the price of SPY
falls to 191, the Delta of the put will become somewhere around -.65 (-.57 - .08). Notice that as price rises, Gamma
adds to the negative Delta and Delta approaches 0. As price falls, Gamma is subtracted from the negative Delta, and
Delta approaches -1.

## So, Why do short options have negative Gamma

<Image1 align="right" width="50%" />

1. Delta is most volatile (Gamma is highest[absolute value]) when an option is ATM, which means the Delta will be the
most unstable
2. As delta approaches 0 or 1 (Deep ITM or Deep OTM) Gamma becomes smaller, meaning Delta will be more stable
3. Gamma is always negative for a short option. You can see the long puts and calls are on the opposite side of the 0
line, but they are affected in exactly the same way by the always negative Gamma.

So if the price of SPY rises to 193, the Delta of the short call will become approximately -.50 (-.42Â  - .08). If the
price of SPY falls to 191, the Delta of the short call will become somewhere around -.34 (.42 + .08). Notice that as
price rises, Gamma subtracts from Delta (making the short call more sensitive to price, and Delta approaches -1. As
price falls, Gamma is added to Delta (making the short call less sensitive to price), and Delta approaches 0.

If the price of SPY rises to 193, the short put Delta will become approximately .49 (.57 - .08). If the price of SPY
falls to 191, the Delta of the short put will become somewhere around .65 (.57 + .08). Notice that as price rises,
Gamma subtracts from the positive Delta (making the short put less sensitive to price), and Delta approaches 0. As
price falls, Gamma is added to the positive Delta, and Delta approaches 1.

## What does this mean

For my own application, mainly as a seller of short options, I can see that gamma forces delta to become more and
more sensitive to price as my short options move against me. Conversely, as they move in my direction, I become less
and less sensitive to price which reflects the limited profitability and undefined risk that is inherent in short
options.
