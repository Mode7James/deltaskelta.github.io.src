## The Problem States:

An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:

<BlockMath math="0.123456789101112131415161718192021..." />

It can be seen that the <InlineMath math="12^th" /> digit of the fractional part is 1.
If <InlineMath math="d_n" /> represents the <InlineMath math="n^th" /> digit of the fractional part, find the value
of the following expression. <InlineMath math="d_{1} * d_{10} * d_{100} * d_{1000} * d_{10000} * d_{100000} * d_{1000000}" />

## My Solution

This was pretty straightforward. I just started with a decimal and added to it until there was enough digits to be
over a million. I kind of just guessed at how many that would be.

I then made a list of the digit numbers I would be checking, it corresponds to the index since I used the decimal
point as the 0 index. I then looped through that list and multiplied the integer found at the indexes to the answer.

## The Code

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

decimal = '.'
for i in range(1, 200000):
    decimal += str(i)

d = [1,10,100,1000,10000,100000,1000000]
answer = 1
for i in d:
    answer *= int(decimal[i])

print answer
print 'finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds'
```

## The Output


```text
210
finished in: 0.094815 seconds
```
