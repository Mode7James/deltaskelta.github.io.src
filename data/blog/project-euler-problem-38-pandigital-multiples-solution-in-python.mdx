## The Problem States

```text
Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:

192 × 1 = 192
192 × 2 = 384
192 × 3 = 576

By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We will call 192384576 the concatenated
product of 192 and (1,2,3)

The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645,
which is the concatenated product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).

What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an
integer with (1,2, ... , n) where n > 1?
```

## My Solution

I thought it would be best to just go through and check everything logically without fiddling with too much. I
thought I should define an upper limit to the problem though.

The number can be multiplied by any sequence as long as the sequence is in order and larger than just 1. So I thought
that if I set it at the largest number (n) that when concatenated by the product of n and 1 and n and 2 was 10
digits, I would be safe.

With that in mind (10,000 x 1) concatenated with (10,000 x 2) is 1,000,020,000. So I used 10,000 as my upper limit to
the problem.

## The Code

```python
import time
start = time.clock()

pan_check = [str(i) for i in range(1, 10)]
# Made a list of the strings of digits 1-9 for checking later

digits = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# List of digits 1-9 for multiplying by

for i in range(1, 10000):
    concat = ''
    for j in digits:
        concat += str(i * j)
        # Adding each consecutive product to the string
        if len(concat) == 9:
            for k in pan_check:
                occurance = concat.count(k)
                if occurance != 1:
                    # If the occurances of each item in k are anything  but 1
                    # I break the loop because it doesn't qualify
                    break
                else:
                    # If it got to the end of the loop checking for occurances, it will
                    # hit this else block and print the concatenated string, i, and j, then break
                    print concat, i, j
                    break

finish = time.clock() - start
print 'finished in: ', finish, 'seconds'
```

## The Output

I think I could speed this up by a lot if I just went backwards from my upper limit and stopped, but I didn't see a
need since it is already pretty fast and performance isn't really an issue for running it one time. The finals answer
is the last answer on the list.
