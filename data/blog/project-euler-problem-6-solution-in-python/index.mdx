## The Problem States

```text
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
```

## My Solution

It is pretty straightforward. I should make a list of the first hundred squares, and sum it. Then make a list of the
first hundred numbers, sum it, and square it. Then I need to take the difference between the two.

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

#Creating the list of squares and then a for loop to sum them
squares = [i**2 for i in range(1, 101)]
squares_sum = 0
for i in squares:
    squares_sum += i

#Creating a list of 1-100 and then summing it with a for loop
sum_list = [i for i in range(1, 101)]
sum_list_sum = 0
for i in sum_list:
    sum_list_sum += i

#squaring the list of sums
sum_list_squared = sum_list_sum ** 2

#Finding the answer
answer = sum_list_squared - squares_sum

print('The sum of the first hundred squares is:', squares_sum)
print('the square of the sum of the 1-100 is:', sum_list_squared)
print('the difference between the two is:', answer)

print()
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
The sum of the first hundred squares is: 338350
the square of the sum of the 1-100 is: 25502500
the difference between the two is: 25164150

finished in: 0.00025529774901793755 seconds
```
