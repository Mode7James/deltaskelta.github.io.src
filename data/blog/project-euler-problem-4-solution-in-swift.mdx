## The Problem States

```text
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
```

## My Solution

```python
import UIKit
import Darwin

func problem4() {

    //Function to check if the number is a palindrome
    func checkPalindrome(number:Int) -> Bool{
        let reverse = Int(String(String(number).characters.reverse()))
        return number == reverse
    }

    var highest: Int = 0
    for i in 100..<1000 {
        for j in 100..<1000 {
            if checkPalindrome(i * j) && i * j > highest {
                highest = i * j
            }
        }
    }
    print(highest)
}

problem4()
```

## The Output

The bad thing about this is that it takes forever to run. It must be a case of swift, because it runs in under a
second in both C and Python, which I have written to be solved in the same way.
