## The Problem States

```text
The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from
left to right, and remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797,
379, 37, and 3.

Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left.

NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.
```

## My Solution

I thought I would make a function that would return a list of numbers truncated from both left and right, which
includes the original number. I could then integrate that into the sieve of Eratosthenes that I made earlier to check
if all the numbers are prime, if they are I can print them and add the original number to the sum.

It's not terribly fast, but it's still under one minute so I'll leave it like this for now.

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

#Takes x as an integer and returns a list of numbers truncated from left and right
def truncate_left_and_right(x):
    # Turns x into a string, and then loops through and appends the integers of x at the stated index positions until all numbers have been used
    trunc = [x]
    x = str(x)
    l = len(x) - 1
    s = 1
    for i in range(0, len(x) - 1):
        # The two appends truncate from left to right, excluding the original number
        trunc.append((int(x[s:])))
        trunc.append((int(x[:l])))
        s += 1
        l -= 1
    return trunc

limit = 1000000
sieve = [True] * limit
sieve[0], sieve[1] = False, False
# Sieve position 0 and 1 False to avoid false positives from having 0 and 1 listed as 'True' prime

answer = 0
for i in range(2, limit):
    if sieve[i]:
        for j in range(i + i, limit, i):
            sieve[j] = False
    if i > 10:
       # Everything until here was the basic sieve.
       # This part takes the truncated list and checks for prime against the sieve, if not broken by a non-prime it prints and adds to the final answer
       x = truncate_left_and_right(i)
       for k in x:
           if not sieve[k]:
           break
       else:
           print(x)
           answer += i

print('The sum is:', answer)
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
[23, 3, 2]
[37, 7, 3]
[53, 3, 5]
[73, 3, 7]
[313, 13, 31, 3, 3]
[317, 17, 31, 7, 3]
[373, 73, 37, 3, 3]
[797, 97, 79, 7, 7]
[3137, 137, 313, 37, 31, 7, 3]
[3797, 797, 379, 97, 37, 7, 3]
[739397, 39397, 73939, 9397, 7393, 397, 739, 97, 73, 7, 7]
The sum is: 748317
finished in: 24.38632973664584 seconds
