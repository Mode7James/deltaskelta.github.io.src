The `golang` tutorial exercise named [Exercise: Slices](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/18) had  me stumped for a
while... `dx` and `dy`?... Is there a derivative here. A little bit more explanation in the beginning would have
helped a lot. I am still not sure why the inputs are named `dx` and `dy`.

## `return` a slice `dy` each element of which is a slice of `dx`?

This was confusing because I generally think of things in terms of `x, y` and I thought this was asking me to return
only a slice of the second dimension of the array which wouldn't make much sense really...Why would it make me
compute more values than necessary if it was only concerned with one "second dimension" array slice.

When I looked over the language more carefully I could see that it wanted an array returned which was actually just
made up of other arrays, a two-dimensional grid array like below.

```
[ [ []dx,[]dx ]dy, [ []dx,[]dx ]dy, [ []dx,[]dx ]dy, [ []dx,[]dx ]dy, [ []dx,[]dx ]dy, [ []dx,[]dx ]dy, [ []dx,[]dx ]dy ]
```

which could print a grid like this...

```
[ [dx] [dx] ]dy
[ [dx] [dx] ]dy
[ [dx] [dx] ]dy
```

It was starting to make a little bit more sense now and I could see what it wanted me to do. The function would make
values to put in the two-dimensional array, and then the imported package would do some magic and convert a value
into a colored pixel and there would be an image, if everything worked correctly.

Notice how the `x` and `y` axes are actually correct like you would expect, they just needs to be put together in
such a way that when they are iterated over, the proper values are placed where you would expect them.

## Code

```go
package main

import "golang.org/x/tour/pic"

func Pic(dx, dy int) [][]uint8 {
  // First, the array has to be made so it can store some values later
  // This only makes the second dimension of the array ([[uint8 dy]])
  image := make([][]uint8, dy)

  //The inputs into the function are Int's, so we have a non-uint8 initializer
  for x := 0; x < dx; x++ {
    // Once inside the loop, the first dimension is made based on dx input value
    image[x] = make([]uint8, dx)
    for y := 0; y < dy; y++ {
      // Finally there is a function to assign pixel values to every slot in the array
      image[x][y] = uint8(x)
    }
  }
  return image
}

func main() {
  pic.Show(Pic)
}
```

## Inputting an `x` value

If you just input pixel values of x then the first loops value remains the same along the x axis and then increases
every time the inner `y` loop finishes an iteration. This results in a pixel value that gets closer to 255 (white) in
only one direction, which is along the y axis (pictured on the left)

<Image1 align="right" width="30%" />

## Inputting a `y` value..

If a value of `y` is the only function input then you get the opposite of x, which increments up to 255 (white) while
in the inner loop instead of the outer loop. It does the same thing on each and every loop which results in the
gradient like pattern that comes out. (pictured on the right)

## Inputting an `x` and `y` value..

It starts to get a bit interesting when something like `x + y` is input because it becomes more dynamic. In this
example the pixel values change in relation to each other. The very top row of pixels will be a straight gradient
like the previous example because x would have been 0 and y would have incremented up to 255.

<Image2 align="left" width="30%" />

On the second row, however, x will have started as 1 and y would have incremented up to 255, the sum would have
reached 255 sooner and therefore it would have turned white sooner. This is what causes the diagonally slanted line
that can be seen in the picture. (pictured on the left)

This raises a question though? What happens when the values go over 255? If a constant value is entered into the
equation, like `256` instead of `x + y` an error will be raised that reads `tmp/sandbox911612058/main.go:18: constant
256 overflows uint8`. This is because it has been fed a constant which is over the max value of `uint8`. If, however,
a value has been assigned to a variable, then it causes the compiler to first load the value into memory (read them
in binary) and then `golang` takes the [least significant bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_significant_bit)
of the resulting expression and displays that.

```go
foo, bar := 255, 1              //computer has read these as 11111111, and 1 respectively
image[x][y] = uint8(foo + bar)  //comptuer reads this as 100000000 and takes rightmost 8 digits
```

This results in a 0 and thus a solid blue pixel which is why there is a solid blue diagonal line in the middle of the
picture

<Image4 align="right" width="30%" />

If an expression like `x * y` is input then this image will be the output (pictured right).  It is quite confusing to
look at so I instead used `x * y / 100` to provide a more "zoomed in" version with less noise and distraction.

Follow this image (pictured left) horizontally along the `x` axis and think about the `x` and `y` values and how they
are interacting with each other.  As `x` and `y` both increase, the rate at which they reach 255 (white) also
increases until they go off the scale and are reset to `0` (blue pixel), at which time they again begin to increase
towards 255 on every iteration, reaching 255 at a quicker rate and thus the "gradient band" gets narrower and narrower.
This keeps on happening over and over. If you will go back and look at the `x * y` image you will see tons of
gradient bands like this throughout the whole image.
