React is great. D3 is great, but they don't mix well together. React has its own great way of handling DOM manipulation,
and D3 has a method chaining way of handling DOM manipulation much like jQuery. This means that using them together
takes some forethought into how we want to do things. We can either:

<LineChart width="100%" data={{ 'series-one': [1, 5, 8, 4, 3, 8, 9] }} />

1. Make a ref and let d3 handle everything in the dom
2. Use React to handle everything in the DOM and only use D3 for scales
3. Use React to handle creation/deletion of DOM elements and use D3 to handle all placements and styling

You can read more in depth about each approach [here](https://frontendcharts.com/react-d3-integrate/). I chose to go
with the third approach because it made the most sense to me. The data in the chart will come in the form of react state
or props and then after everything is created, d# can handle placement, transitions, etc the way it normally does.

Using the third method also means that you  can create things like tooltips using whatever UI lib you are using with
React. Instead of using a long method chain to create tooltips [as outlined
here](http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/a22c42db65eb00d4e369) you can just let React handle everything with components as usual

This is assuming your data for the line chart comes in the form `{[k :string]: number[]}`

```tsx
{Object.keys(data).map(k =>
  data[k].map((d, i) => (
    <Tooltip key={`${k}${i}`} title={`${k}: ${d}`}>
      <circle className={classnames('dot', `dot-${k}`)} />
    </Tooltip>
  ))
)}
```

Each circle will have the class of the data key which can then be used by
