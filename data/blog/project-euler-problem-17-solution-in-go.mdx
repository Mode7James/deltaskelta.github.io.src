## The Problem States:

```
If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?

NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.
```

## My Solution

Its a pretty straightforward walkthrough of just logically thinking about how to logically count the letters.

- Put all the spellings into a slice
- Deal with special cases for the teen numbers
- Deal with different blocks of numbers that follow a pattern
- Deal with the hundreds and the addition of the word 'and'

After all of that is done, you can just add the `len` after converting to a `slice` of `rune`s on every iteration.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
)

func main() {
  ones := []string{
    "", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine",
    "ten", "eleven", "twelve", "thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen", "sixteen", "seventeen",
    "eighteen", "nineteen"}

  tens := []string{
    "", "ten", "twenty", "thirty", "forty", "fifty", "sixty", "seventy", "eighty", "ninety"}

  special := []string{"hundred", "thousand", "and"}
  sum := 0
  for i := 1; i <= 1000; i++ {
    t := i
    number := ""
    if 100 <= t && t < 1000 {
      number += fmt.Sprintf("%s%s%s", ones[t / 100], special[0], special[2])
      t = t % 100
    }
    switch true {
    case t == 0:
      number = number[:len([]rune(number)) - 3]
    case 1 <= t && t <= 19:
      number += fmt.Sprintf("%s", ones[t])
      break
    case 20 <= t && t < 100:
      number += fmt.Sprintf("%s%s", tens[t / 10], ones[t % 10])
      break
    case t == 1000:
      number += fmt.Sprintf("%s%s", ones[1], special[1])
    default:
      fmt.Printf("error")
    }
    sum += len([]rune(number))
  }
  fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

## The Output

```bash
21124
```
