## The Problem States

> <p>2<sup>15</sup> = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.</p>
>
> What is the sum of the digits of the number 2<sup>1000</sup>?

## My Solution

This problem becomes pretty easy with the `math/big`library I just make the number `2` and `1000` of type `big.Int`
and then use the `Exp` function to set `2` to the `1000`.

I then make a loop using the `big.Cmp` function as a condition ([function here](https://golang.org/pkg/math/big/#Int.Cmp)).
I meet the condition eventually by using `big.DivMod` which divides the number by `10` and also returns the divided
number and the modulus. I need to add the modulus of `number % 10` on every iteration because that will pull off the
last digit which I then add to the sum.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "math/big"
)

func main() {
  number := big.NewInt(2)
  number.Exp(number, big.NewInt(1000), nil)
  sum := big.NewInt(0)
  for ; number.Cmp(big.NewInt(1)) > -1; {
    _, mod := number.DivMod(number, big.NewInt(10), big.NewInt(0))
    sum.Add(sum, mod)
  }
  fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

## The Output

```bash
1366
```
