## The Problem States

```text
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9.
The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
```

## My Solution

This was my first time writing anything in `go`. I am still working my way through the tutorial so I have not learned
everything there yet.

I am unsure if `switch` is the proper thing to do here, but I could not find any `or` statements so I had to go with
that for now. In any case, it works.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  var sum int
  for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
    switch {
    case i % 3 == 0:
      sum += i
    case i % 5 == 0:
      sum += i
    }
  }
  fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

## The Output
