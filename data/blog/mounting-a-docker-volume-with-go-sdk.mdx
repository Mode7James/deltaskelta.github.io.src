this is for a post about how to mount a docker volume in a container using the go sdk. It is not very obvious from the docs

```
resp, err := cli.ContainerCreate(
  context.Background(),
  &container.Config{
    Image: id,
  },
  &container.HostConfig{
    Mounts: []mount.Mount{
      mount.Mount{
        Target:   "/var/lib/mysql",
        Source:   "youshowprocom_mysql-test",
        Type:     "volume",
        ReadOnly: false,
      },
    },
  },
  &network.NetworkingConfig{},
  "container",
)
```
