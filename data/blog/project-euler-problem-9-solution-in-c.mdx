## The Problem States

```text
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

a2 + b2 = c2
For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.
```

## My Solution

The first loop starts at 0 and goes up to 1000, the second loop starts at the first loops number + 1 since b > a and
the third loop starts at b + 1 since b > c, then I added two consecutive if statements to check that a^2 + b^2 = c^s
and also check if that is 1000. Since the problem stated there was definitely only one case in which this happens, it
prints the number and returns 0 when it finds it.

```c
int problem9() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < 1000; j++) {
            for (int k = j + 1; k < 1000; k++) {
                if ( i*i + j*j == k*k ){
                    if ( i + j + k == 1000 ) {
                        printf("%d\n", i*j*k );
                        return 0;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    //Added to avoid generating errors
    printf("Something went wrong");
    return 1;
}


int main ()
{
    clock_t start = clock();

    problem9();

    clock_t end = clock();
    double time_elapsed_in_seconds = (end - start)/(double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
    printf("Finished in %f seconds.\n", time_elapsed_in_seconds);
}
```

## The Output

```text
31875000
Finished in 0.230988 seconds.
```
