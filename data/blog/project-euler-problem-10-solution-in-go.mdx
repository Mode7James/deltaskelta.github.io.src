## The Problem States

```
The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

Find the sum of all the primes below two million.
```

## My Solution

I implemented a prime sieve which is a slice of two million boolean values which are initialized to false. `0` and
`1` are set to `true` to indicate that they are not prime (prime numbers are greater than 2).

From this point I iterate through the slice and every time I come upon a `false` value then I know its `index` must
be prime, so the `index` is added to the sum. I also know that all the multiples of that index are not prime.

I then create another loop that sets all the multiples of the primes `index` to `true` to indicate that they are not
prime.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  var sieve [2000000]bool
  sieve[0], sieve[1] = true, true
  sum := 0
  for i := 2; i < len(sieve); i++ {
    if !sieve[i] {
      sum += i
      for j := i; j < len(sieve); j += i{
        sieve[j] = true
      }
    }
  }
  fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

## The Output

```bash
142913828922
```
