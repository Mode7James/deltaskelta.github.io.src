## The Problem States

```text
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
```

## My Solution

```swift
func problem6() -> Int {
    var sumSq:Int = 0
    var sqSum:Int = 0

    for i in 1...100 {
        sumSq += i * i
        sqSum += i
    }

    sqSum *= sqSum
    return(sqSum - sumSq)
}

print(problem6())
```

## The Output

```text
"25164150\n"
```
