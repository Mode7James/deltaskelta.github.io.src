## The Problem States

```text
If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19
letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?
NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one
hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.
```

## My Solution

My first thought was to make a list of all the spellings of the numbers, but then I thought it might be easier to
type just the number of letters in them and just add them later. Either one would probably work fine, but there would
be less typing if I just used the number to represent the number of letters.

It came out to be a little bit longer than I thought it would, but I commented it pretty well, so it should make
sense when going through it. I made the code take an input from the user as well.

```python
import time

#Instead of just using the computer to sum the digits I wanted to make a formula where I could enter whatever number I
#Wanted and it would sum them all up, I thought it would be a bit harder and more useful to me
x = input('Please input the top number in the range to sum: ')
x = int(x)

start_time = time.clock()

num_list = [i for i in range(1, x + 1)]
print('the number list', num_list)

#length of digits starting at 0, ending at 19. [0] is 0 because I wanted the indexes to match up with the #'s
S = [0, 3, 3, 5, 4, 4, 3, 5, 5, 4, 3, 6, 6, 8, 8, 7, 7, 9, 8, 8]
#again starting with 0 and moving up ten, twenty, etc. H and T are hundred and thousand
D = [0, 3, 6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 7, 6, 6]
H = 7
T = 8

#In this loop I decided to make a list with all the letter lengths of all the numbers
sum_list = []
for i in num_list:
    #I made index equal to i so I wouldn't have to modify the i
    index = i
    #i up to 19 uses a different pattern than the rest, because of the 'teens'
    if i <= 19:
        #Index will be the same as the number here
        sum_list.append(S[index])
    elif 20 <= i < 100:
        #The singles index will be the same number as i % 10
        s_index = index % 10
        #While i is less than 100, the tens spot will be i // 10 (10 // 10 = 1) so D[1] = 3 letters for 'ten'
        d_index = index // 10
        sum_list.append(D[d_index] + S[s_index])
    #This is the part where things got a little bit more complicated than I thought
    elif 100 <= i < 1000:
        #sindex is the last digit, dindex gets rid of the last digit and then %'s by 10
        s_index = index % 10
        d_index = index // 10
        d_index %= 10
        #Hname is just the digit(index) of the hundreds spot
        h_name = index // 100
        #I made this print statement to check everything
        #print(i, h_name, 'hundred', d_index, 'tens', s_index, 'singles', S[h_name], H, 3, D[d_index], S[s_index])
        if 10 < index % 100 < 20:
            #This section caused me some trouble because i forgot the hundreds sections 11-19 would be a little
            #different. I also had to add a 3 for 'and'
            s_index += 10
            sum_list.append(S[h_name] + H + 3 + S[s_index])
        elif index % 100 == 0:
            #If the index is an even 100 then it shouldn't add a 3 for 'and' to the sum
            sum_list.append(S[h_name] + H)
        else:
            #Most of the digits will end up in this spot, adding the and
            sum_list.append(S[h_name] + H + 3 + D[d_index] + S[s_index])
    elif index == 1000:
        #Since this was only supposed to go up to 1000 I stopped here
        t_name = i // 1000
        sum_list.append(T + S[t_name])
    else:
        #If there was some error, it would print into the list
        sum_list.append('error')

print('the number of letters in each number is:', sum_list)

# The loop that adds everything together
the_sum = 0
for i in sum_list:
    the_sum += i

print('the sum of all the digits is:', the_sum)
print()
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```
