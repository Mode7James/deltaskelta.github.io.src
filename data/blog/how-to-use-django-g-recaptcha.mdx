I wrote an app for django which you can use to decorate views and validate google's recaptcha.  I couldn't find
anything on pypi that worked for me, so I wrote this to be really simple. A few things have to be configured but it
works...

It includes support for ajax calls to, so if the request is ajax and the user makes a mistake, or something goes wrong
, it will not refresh the page and possibly erase the form they were filling out. This of course only works if you
send it with ajax and then manually add the error response back into the page with javascript.

## Install django-g-recaptcha, and add it to your installed apps...

```bash
pip install django-g-recaptcha
```

## Or you can download and install manually at [GitHub](https://github.com/deltaskelta/django-g-recaptcha.git)

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'g_recaptcha',
)
```

## Add your recaptcha keys **obtained from google** to your settings.py file...

```python
GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY = 'key_obtained_from_google'
GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY = 'key_obtained_from_google'
```

## Pass the key into your view context...

```python
from django.conf import settings
def view(request):

context = {
    'GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY': settings.GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY,
}

return render(request, 'template.html', context)
```

## Add the google re-captcha script to the head of your html file and add a div for the re-captcha to be put into...

```html
<head>
    <script src='https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js'></script>
</head>

<div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="{{ GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY }}"></div>
```

## Add the decorator to your view...

```python
from g_recaptcha.validate_captcha import validate_captcha
```

## For a normal view

```python
@validate_captcha
def view(request):
    ...
```

## For a class based view

```python
from django.utils.decorators import method_decorator

class MyView(View):
    def get():
        ...
    @method_decorator(validate_captcha)
    def post():
        ...
```

It automatically supports ajax, so if the captcha was successfully validated, it will return your view, and if it
fails, it will check to see if the request was ajax, and return an HttpResponse if it was ajax. That way you can have
it return with a refreshed page or not.

If you do not use an ajax request, you should override the default template with your own template that fits your site.
