Sometimes I need to make a pull request on a node dependency. In order to inject the modified version into the project,
I find it easiest to follow this method.

```bash
git clone github.com/myfork/dep
git checkout -b descriptive-branch
cd ~/my-project-dir
yarn add file:/absolute/path/to/file
```

this adds a local file fork of the repo to `package.json` which I can work on and try to fix. If my PR is accepted I
remove the dependency and add it again the normal way.
