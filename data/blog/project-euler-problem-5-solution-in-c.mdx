## The Problem States

    2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

    What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

## My Solution

### First Attempt...

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <time.h>

int main ()
{
  clock_t start = clock();
  int limit = 20;
  int begin = 2520;
  int cont = 1;
  while (cont) {
    if (begin % limit == 0) {
      while (begin % limit == 0) {
        limit--;
        if (limit == 0) {
          printf("%d\n", begin);
          cont = 0;
          break;
        }
      }
      limit = 20;
      begin++;
    } else {
      begin++;
    }
  }
  clock_t end = clock();

    double time_elapsed_in_seconds = (end - start)/(double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
    printf("Finished in %f seconds.\n", time_elapsed_in_seconds);
}
```

### First Attempt Output...

    232792560
    Finished in 1.253245 seconds.

I tired this the first time and thought it was a bit slow so I looked at my python solution and realized that I could increment the number each time by 20 since it has o be divisible by 20. That should cut down on a lot of possibilities.

### Second Attempt...

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <time.h>

int main ()
{
  clock_t start = clock();
  int limit = 20;
  int begin = 20;
  int cont = 1;
  while (cont) {
    if (begin % limit == 0) {
      while (begin % limit == 0) {
        limit--;
        if (limit == 0) {
          printf("%d\n", begin);
          cont = 0;
          break;
        }
      }
      limit = 20;
      begin += 20;
    } else {
      begin += 20;
    }
  }
  clock_t end = clock();

    double time_elapsed_in_seconds = (end - start)/(double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
    printf("Finished in %f seconds.\n", time_elapsed_in_seconds);
}
```

## The Output


```bash
232792560
Finished in 0.156097 seconds.
```

This was a pretty big performance gain, but I wasn't able to replicate the speed in my
[python](/post/project-euler-problem-5-solution-in-python/) answer for some reason, I actually don't understand what
I was saying about the primes...I want to go back and look at it sometime, but this is good enough for now.
