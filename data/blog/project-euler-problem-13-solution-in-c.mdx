## The Problem States

```
Work out the first ten digits of the sum of the following one-hundred 50-digit numbers.
```

You can look at the problem [here](https://projecteuler.net/problem=13) to see all of the numbers given.

## My Solution

What I did was to save all the numbers in a text file. I wanted to have some more practice with opening and reading
from files.

I had to first scan the file and get its size, then allocate the needed space in memory, read the file into memory
and assigning the `strings` to an array. I then had to iterate through the array and make them into numbers (using a
special datatype from the GMP library) and add it to the sum.

This program was a pain to write in C because I had to go through and use special datatypes, meticulously allocate
memory and make sure that the array dimensions had a nullbyte at the end to terminate properly. This would have been
so much easier to write in Python or any number of other languages...

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <string.h>
//Adding the gmp library so I can do arbitrary integer size addition
//when I compile this code I have to do it like this gcc -o <outfile> <infile.c> -lgmp
#include <gmp.h>

//my function to return the number of divisors of a certain number
int main ()
{
  clock_t start = clock();

  FILE *numbers = fopen("./e13.txt", "r");

  //seeking the end of the file to get the correct size for the string
  //I will store
  fseek(numbers, 0, SEEK_END);
  long fsize = ftell(numbers);
  fseek(numbers, 0, SEEK_SET);

  //Allocating memory to the string
  char *string = malloc(fsize + 1);

  //reading the string and assigning it to the address of my string
  fread(string, fsize, 1, numbers);
  fclose(numbers);

  //Initializing the sum variable as a GMP mpz_t datatype and setting it to 0
  mpz_t sum;
  mpz_init_set_str(sum, "0", 10);
  //the second dimension of the array set to 51 to have the proper null byte at the end
  char nums[100][51];
  int stringIndex = 0;
  for ( int i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {
    for ( int j = 0; j < 50; j++) {
      nums[i][j] = string[stringIndex];
      stringIndex++;
    }
    //adding one to the current string index to skip over the newline character > adding nullbyte
    stringIndex++;
    nums[i][50] = '\0';
    //Initializing the current 50 digit num variable and setting it equal to nums[i]
    mpz_t current;
    mpz_init_set_str(current, nums[i], 10);
    //Adding it to the sum and releasing it as it is finished
    mpz_add(sum, sum, current);
    mpz_clear(current);

  }

  printf (" The sum of all the 50 digit numbes is: ");
    mpz_out_str(stdout, 10, sum);
    printf ("\n");

  clock_t end = clock();
    double time_elapsed_in_seconds = (end - start)/(double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
    printf("Finished in %f seconds.\n", time_elapsed_in_seconds);
}
```

## The Output

```bash
The sum of all the 50 digit numbes is: 5537376230390876637302048746832985971773659831892672
Finished in 0.000876 seconds.
```
