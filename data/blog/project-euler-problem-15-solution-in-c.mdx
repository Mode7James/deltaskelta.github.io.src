## The Problem States

```text
Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6
routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?
```

There are pictures in the actual problem you can see [HERE](https://projecteuler.net/problem=15)

## My Solution

The problem can be solved by adding the possible ways to each part of the lattice which is simple to see when you
write out the patterns. [EXAMPLE HERE](http://www.robertdickau.com/lattices.html)

I made a function that would take one input and make a two dimensional array from that input. From there I have a few
cases where I need to add a one (If it is in the top row or left column of the array pictured as a square). From
there I add the possible paths to the previous horizontal square `array[i][j-1]` and the possible paths to the square
vertically above the current square `array[i-1][j]`.

I made a mistake initially by using an input of `3` for attempting the answer for a 3x3 square but that didn't work
because a 3x3 cube will actually have 4 vertices that I have to deal with. In this case if I want a 20x20 square, I
must se 21 as an input. the answer will lie on the last squares bottom corner which will be `array[x-1][x-1]` since
the indexing starts at `0`.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

long lattice(int x) {
  long lattice[x][x];
  for ( int i = 0; i < x; i++ ) {
    for ( int j = 0; j < x; j++ ) {
      if ( i == 0 ) {
        lattice[i][j] = 1;
      }
      else if ( j == 0 ) {
        lattice[i][j] = 1;
      }
      else {
        lattice[i][j] = lattice[i-1][j] + lattice[i][j-1];
      }
    }
  }
  return lattice[x-1][x-1];
}

int main ()
{
  clock_t start = clock();

  printf("%ld\n", lattice(21));

  clock_t end = clock();
    double time_elapsed_in_seconds = (end - start)/(double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
    printf("Finished in %f seconds.\n", time_elapsed_in_seconds);
}
```

## The Output

```text
137846528820
Finished in 0.000034 seconds.
```
