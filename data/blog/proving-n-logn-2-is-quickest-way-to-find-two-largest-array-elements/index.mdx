The fastest method to find the largest member of an array is to compare each element with its neighbor, choosing the
larger element and  then comparing all winners with other winners and so forth much like a tournament bracket is set
up.

<TreeChart
  width="75%"
  align="center"
  data={{
    name: 'winner',
    children: [
      {
        name: 'loser-1-1',
        children: [
          {
            name: 'loser2-1',
            children: [
              { name: 'loser3-1', children: [{ name: 'loser4-1' }, { name: 'loser4-2' }] },
              { name: 'loser3-2', children: [{ name: 'loser4-1' }, { name: 'loser4-2' }] }
            ]
          },
          {
            name: 'loser2-2',
            children: [
              { name: 'loser3-1', children: [{ name: 'loser4-1' }, { name: 'loser4-2' }] },
              { name: 'loser3-2', children: [{ name: 'loser4-1' }, { name: 'loser4-2' }] }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }}
/>

In the example here, the number of beginning elements is 8 every element is compared once (count the nodes where a
decision is made), we can say that there are <InlineMath math="n - 1 = 7" comparisons to find the max element. The
second largest element in the list must have lost to the largest somewhere along the line. It could have been in the
first comparison or the last. Counting the layers of comparisons shows that there are <InlineMath math="log_2 n" />
comparisons where the second largest could have lost to the largest.

Finding the largest element can be done with a complexity of <InlineMath math="n - 1" /> so therefore finding the
largest in the list of losers is <InlineMath math="log_2 - 1" />.

Therefore <InlineMath math="n + log_2 n - 1" /> is the fastest possible method of finding the greatest to elements in an
array.

## What is the fastest algorithm for finding three largest elements?
