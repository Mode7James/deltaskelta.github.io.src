## The Problem States

We shall say that an <InlineMath math="n-digit" /> is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits <InlineMath
math="1-n" /> exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, <InlineMath math="39 × 186 = 7254" />, containing multiplicand,
multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

- *HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.*

## My Solution

My first thought is just brute force it because I haven't been able to come up with a reasonable way to cut down on
the calculations yet. I think I should take all the numbers up to a certain point, eliminate any that have repeat
numbers. Then I should loop through and take all the factors of each remaining number, and check to make sure they:

1. are 9 digits in length (2 factors and the original number)
2. are pan-digital
3. multiply to equal the number

```python
import time
from aFormulas import all_factors
start_time = time.clock()


def pandigit_chk(x):
#This can be easily changed to 0-9 if you take out s[0] = False. It creates a true for all the digits, and
#then turns that value to False once it hits those digits. If it then hits a false, it must have hit a
#repeat so it returns False.
s = [True] * 10
s[0] = False
x = str(x)
for i in x:
    i = int(i)
 if s[i]:
    s[i] = False
 else:
     return False
 return True

pans = [i for i in range(1000, 10000) if pandigit_chk(i)]
finals = []
for i in pans:
    #I picked 10,000 as the upper limit because, it would be rather hard for a 6 digit number to be a product of
    #3 remaining digits.
    x, lenx = str(i), len(str(i))
    fac = all_factors(i)
    for j in fac:
        for k in fac:
            # I found all the factors, and then ran all the factors against each other to check that the total length
            # was 9 (digits 1-9) and that it was pandigital, and that j * k = i
            fac1, len1 = str(j), len(str(j))
            fac2, len2 = str(k), len(str(k))
            tot_len, digits = lenx + len1 + len2, x + fac1 + fac2
            if tot_len == 9 and pandigit_chk(digits) and j * k == i:
                finals.append(i)
else:
#Made a set of the list to eliminate duplicates, and added them together.
answer = 0
finals = list(set(finals))
    for i in finals:
        answer += i

print(finals)
print(answer)
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
[5346, 5796, 6952, 4396, 7852, 7632, 7254]
45228
finished in: 3.4213965844012777 seconds
```
