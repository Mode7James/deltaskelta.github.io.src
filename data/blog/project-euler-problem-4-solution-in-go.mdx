## The Problem States

```
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
```

## My Solution

The reverse function was a little bit tricky to nail down. but I took something I found online in [this SO post](http
://stackoverflow.com/questions/1752414/how-to-reverse-a-string-in-go) and modified it to be something I can use for
this function. It takes the first index and the last index of the given string (in this case the rune function
converts the string to ASCII values) and returns false if they do not match each other. If they do match it continues
towards the "center" of the array of values.

If the string is of an odd length then the middle value will be left alone, because the condition `i < j` will have
been met. If the array is of an even length it will match it until the "center" and then the condition of `i < j`
will have been met and it will terminate the loop and return `true` (because it has not already returned `false`
inside the loop.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "strconv"
)

func is_palindrome(s string) bool {
      // Type conversion to rune gives an array of values back
    runes := []rune(s)
      // Starts at first and last values and compares them to each other, working towards the middle
    for i, j := 0, len(runes)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
        if runes[i] != runes[j] {
          return false
        }
    }
    return true
}

func main () {
  var answer int
  for i := 100; i < 1000; i++ {
    for j := i + 1; j < 1000; j++ {
      if i * j > answer && is_palindrome(strconv.Itoa(i * j)) {
        answer = i * j
      }
    }
  }
  fmt.Println(answer)
}
```

## The Output

```bash
906609
```
