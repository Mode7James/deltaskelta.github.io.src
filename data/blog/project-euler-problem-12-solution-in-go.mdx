## The Problem States

```
The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

 1: 1
 3: 1,3
 6: 1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
```

## My Solution

I wrote a divisors function that returns a slice of integers containing all of the divisors for a `n`. It iterates
through numbers up to the `sqrt(n) + 1` and if it is an even division, it appends the divisor and `n/divisor` to the
slice.

I also added a timing function so that I can time how long my solutions take.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "math"
  "time"
)

func timeTrack(start time.Time, name string) {
    elapsed := time.Since(start)
    fmt.Printf("%s took %s\n", name, elapsed)
}

func divisors(n int) []int {
  var divisors []int
  divisors = append(divisors, 1, n)
  for i := 2; i < int(math.Sqrt(float64(n))) + 1; i++ {
    if n % i == 0 {
      divisors = append(divisors, i, n/i)
    }
  }
  return divisors
}

func main() {
  defer timeTrack(time.Now(), "main")

  triangle := 0
  for i := 1; ; i++ {
    triangle += i
    if len(divisors(triangle)) > 500 {
      fmt.Println(triangle)
      return
    }
  }
}
```

## The Output

```bash
76576500
```
