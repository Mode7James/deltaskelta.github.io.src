## The Problem States

```
By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

3
7 4
2 4 6
8 5 9 3

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:

75
95 64
17 47 82
18 35 87 10
20 04 82 47 65
19 01 23 75 03 34
88 02 77 73 07 63 67
99 65 04 28 06 16 70 92
41 41 26 56 83 40 80 70 33
41 48 72 33 47 32 37 16 94 29
53 71 44 65 25 43 91 52 97 51 14
70 11 33 28 77 73 17 78 39 68 17 57
91 71 52 38 17 14 91 43 58 50 27 29 48
63 66 04 68 89 53 67 30 73 16 69 87 40 31
04 62 98 27 23 09 70 98 73 93 38 53 60 04 23

NOTE: As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route. However, Problem 67,
is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a
clever method! ;o)
```

## My Solution

I first had to figure out how to read the numbers from a file so I wrote a `ByteToInt` function which takes a slice
of bytes, splits it by whitespace and then converts them to integers and appends them to another slice which is
returned. I should be able to use that function to read each line and end up with a slice of slice of integers.

For the maximum total paths I started from the bottom row and tried to add each number of the triangle to the node
above it, Setting the node above to whichever result is greater. In a small triangle it will look like this...

```
 1
2 3
```

if `3+1` is greater, then `1` becomes `4`, if `1+2` is greater, then `1` becomes `3`. If that is done all the way
from the bottom to the top, it should give a pretty efficient solution to the problem.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"
  "bufio"
  "bytes"
  "strconv"
)

// Takes a slice of bytes and returns slice of ints separated by whitespace
func ByteToInt(b []byte) []int {
  s := bytes.Split(b, []byte(" "))
  var ints []int
  for i := 0; i < len(s); i++ {
    x, err := strconv.Atoi(string(s[i]))
    if err != nil {
      panic(err)
    }
    ints = append(ints, x)
  }
  return ints
}

// Starts from the bottom row and adds each possibility choosing the highest
// yielding sum
func MaxTotalPath(s [][]int) int {
  // i is equal to the length of s - 1 so it will start at the end
  for i := len(s) - 1; i > -1; i-- {
    for j := 0; j < len(s[i]) - 1; j++ {
      // Get the result of adding each number to the number above it.
      opt1 := s[i][j] + s[i-1][j]
      opt2 := s[i][j+1] + s[i-1][j]
      if opt1 > opt2 {
        s[i-1][j] = opt1
      } else {
        s[i-1][j] = opt2
      }
    }
  }
  // after it has gone through the entire list, the point at 0,0 should be correct
  return s[0][0]
}

func main() {
  infile, _ := os.Open("18.txt")
  reader := bufio.NewReader(infile)
  var numbers [][]int
  for {
    line, _, ok := reader.ReadLine()
    if ok != nil {break}
    numbers = append(numbers, ByteToInt(line))
  }
  fmt.Println(MaxTotalPath(numbers))
}
```

## The Output

```bash
1074
```
