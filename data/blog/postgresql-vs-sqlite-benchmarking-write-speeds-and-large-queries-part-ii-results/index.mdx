In order to test how well PostgreSQL and SQLite perform on a small machine, I wrote a script that would access each
endpoint of the API that I created in
[Part: I](https://jrwillette.com/post/postgresql-vs-sqlite-benchmarking-large-queries-part-i-making-a-django-project/).
I let this run, which times how long it took to create, retrieve, and destroy objects with each database in each amount.

## PostgreSQL / SQLite create/destroy

```text
name: createDestroy
type: line
labels: objects, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000, 64000, 128000, 256000
sqlite-create: 0, 3.672, 7.4, 16.96, 29.49, 62.12, 120.24, 259.24, 556.13, 1223.25, 2549.58
sqlite-destroy: 0, 3.63, 6.89, 17.12, 32.15, 58.80, 133.09, 252.46, 569.35, 1233.57, 2535.18
postgresql-create: 0, 2.26, 5.01, 9.80, 20.11, 34.72, 63.87, 129.277, 276.99, 637.08, 1418.89
postgresql-destroy: 0, 2.02, 4.51, 9.01, 21.15, 33.14, 63.62, 136.50, 291.17, 663.59, 934.69
```

It is pretty obvious to see that PostgreSQL has a huge advantage when it is writing or destroying a large number of
objects. The advantage extends all the way down to the beginning of the chart, which is hard to see with the numbers
doubling every time, so here is a closer view of the beginning of the chart...

```text
name: createDestroySmall
type: line
labels: 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000
sqlite-create: 3.672, 7.4, 16.96, 29.49, 62.12
sqlite-destroy: 3.63, 6.89, 17.12, 32.15, 58.80
postgresql-create: 2.26, 5.01, 9.80, 20.11, 34.72
postgresql-destroy: 2.02, 4.51, 9.01, 21.15, 33.14
```

It was surprising to see such a huge difference in write speeds and then see the following chart showing the read
speeds are almost identical all the way up.

## PostgreSQL / SQLite - retrieve

```text
name: dbRetrieve
type: line
labels: 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000, 64000, 128000, 256000
sqlite-retrieve: 0.02, 0.04, 0.09, 0.14, 0.203, 0.525, 1.336, 2.286, 8.524, 26.57
postgresql-retrieve: 0.06, 0.061, 0.104, 0.198, 0.361, 0.881, 1.05, 3.08, 7.08, 27.21
```

From this data it is pretty easy to see that if an application is doing any heavy writing to SQLite, it may be
beneficial to switch to PostgreSQL or (probably) MySQL even if there is only one writer.
