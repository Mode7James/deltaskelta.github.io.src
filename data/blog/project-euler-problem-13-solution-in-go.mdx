## The Problem States

```
Work out the first ten digits of the sum of the following one-hundred 50-digit numbers.
```

- [View the number here](https://projecteuler.net/problem=13)

## My Solution

Pretty simple, I just split the numbers on the newline characters and then used the `math/big` library to create big
numbers and add them to the sum which is also a `big` number.

I thought about going through the columns and adding the numbers like one would do by hand, but that would require
converting everything to an integer and then iterating through the columns which seemed a lot more tedious than just
using the `math/big` library

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "io/ioutil"
  "strings"
  "math/big"
)

func main() {
  contents, err := ioutil.ReadFile("13.txt")
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }

  strNumbers := strings.Split(string(contents), "\n")
  sum := big.NewInt(0)
  for i := 0; i < len(strNumbers); i++ {
    number := big.NewInt(0)
    if _, ok := number.SetString(strNumbers[i], 10); ok {
      sum.Add(sum, number)
    } else {
      fmt.Println("There was an error making an integer")
    }
  }
  for i := 0; i < 10; i ++ {
    fmt.Printf("%c", sum.String()[i])
  }
  fmt.Println()
}
```

## The Output

```bash
