## The Problem States

```text
Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The
proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
```

## My Solution

I had a previous solution that took over 100 seconds and I was able to cut that down to just under 2 with some easy fixes.

First of all, according to the definition of the amicable numbers, I know that no prime number can be amicable,
because if it is prime, the sum of its factors is 1, and the sum of one cannot equal anything greater than 1. So I
can eliminate those right away.

Then I should find all the factors of the remaining non prime numbers and add them up, and store the number and the
sum of the factors. If that sum of factors is also not prime, and not equal to the number, I should take all the
factors of the sum and add them up. If the sum of the factors of the first sum are equal to the starting number, I
will have an amicable match. I should then append these to a list if it does not already exist in the list.

1. Make a list of non-prime numbers in the range.
2. Find all the factors and sum them.
3. take that sum and check to make sure it is not prime, or equal to the original number.
4. if it makes it here, take the factors of the sum and sum them together.
5. Take the second sum and see if it is equal to the starting number.
6. If they match, append them to a list if they do not already exist in the list.

For previous problems, I have already written some functions that I have saved for future use that include functions
that check for primality, and functions that will return all the factors of a number efficiently. I have included
those below and then imported them from my own files in the solution.

## Previously Written Functions

```python
#Checks for primality
def is_prime(x):
   #I shouldn't need to divide by any number larger than the square root, because if there is a number larger than
   #the square root that will divide evenly it is either prime and multiplied by another number to equal x,
   #making x not prime, or an unprime factor of x will be composite and therefore making x composite as well
   if x < 0:
       x *= -1
       div_by = [i for i in range(2, int(x ** 0.5) + 1)]
       for i in div_by:
           #if a divisor in the list divides evenly, break
           if x % i == 0:
           break
       else:
           #if it gets to this point it must be prime, return true
           return True

def all_factors(x):
   #I should look for factors under the square root of x and add them only if x / it == 0?
   factors = []
   root = int((x ** .5) + 1)
   divisors = [i for i in range(1, root)]
   for i in divisors:
       j = x / i
       if x % i == 0 and x % j == 0 and j != i:
           factors.append(i)
           factors.append(int(j))
       elif j == i:
           factors.append(i)
   factors.sort()
   return factors



import time
#Importing the formulas above from this file
import aFormulas
start_time = time.clock()

#Eliminating the prime numbers
a_range = [i for i in range(1, 10000) if not aFormulas.is_prime(i)]

a_list = []
for i in a_range:
    #Taking all factors, minus the last factor(i) and then summing
    temp_sum = 0
    x = aFormulas.all_factors(i)
    x = x[:len(x) - 1]
    for j in x:
        temp_sum += j
    else:
        #On the exit, I make a list to test, with i and the sum
        am_test_one = [i, temp_sum]
        if aFormulas.is_prime(temp_sum) or i == temp_sum:
            #If the sum is prime or equal to i, we can stop here because its not possible for it to be amicable
            pass
        else:
            #If it gets to here, we can run a test on the sum to see if it is amicable with the original number
            temp_sum_two = 0
            y = aFormulas.all_factors(temp_sum)
            y = y[:len(y) - 1]
            for k in y:
                temp_sum_two += k
            else:
                #On the exit of this for loop, we will make a second list to test against the first.
                am_test_two = [temp_sum, temp_sum_two]
                if temp_sum_two == i and am_test_one and am_test_two not in a_list:
                    #If the sum of the factors of the first sum is equal to the original number (temp_sum_two == i) we can append the two amicable numbers to a list and sum it later
                    a_list.append(am_test_one)
                    a_list.append(am_test_two)

#Printed to make sure it was all working correctly
print(a_list)

am_sum = 0
for i in a_list:
    #Summing the 0 index, which is our goal
    am_sum += i[0]

print(am_sum)
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```
