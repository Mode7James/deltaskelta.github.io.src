## The Problem States

```text
Using "names.txt" a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical
order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the
list to obtain a name score.

For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the
938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
```

## My Solution

The hardest part I had about this was manipulating the name file to get the data the way I wanted it to begin. Once I
got that down, the rest was pretty easy. I was trying all sorts of loops to get it the way I wanted but in the end I
had to replace all the ' " ' with '' meaning replace it with nothing. I then had a list with nothing but letters and
commas. I then split it at the commas so I had a list like this: ['name', 'name'...]

```python
import time
start_time = time.clock()

the_name_file = open('Euler22names.txt', 'r')
names = the_name_file.read().replace('&quot;', '').split(',')
names.sort()
the_name_file.close()

alpha = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z']
# Defining the alphabet

print('the name list is:', names[:10])
# Printed to make sure that everything was in order

names_numbers = []
#I made a new list to append the final data

score_sum = 0
names_index = 0
for i in names:
    # i is each name
    temp_sum = 0
    for j in i:
        # j is each letter in the name
        temp_sum += alpha.index(j) + 1
    else:
        # on exit, it will append the name, and the product of the sum and position, and move index
        product = temp_sum * (names.index(i) + 1)
        names_numbers.append([i, product])
        score_sum += product

print('[name, score] =', names_numbers[:10])
print('the sum of all the scores is:', score_sum)
print('finished in:', time.clock() - start_time, 'seconds')
```

## The Output

```text
the name list is: ['AARON', 'ABBEY', 'ABBIE', 'ABBY', 'ABDUL', 'ABE', 'ABEL', 'ABIGAIL', 'ABRAHAM', 'ABRAM']
[name, score] = [['AARON', 49], ['ABBEY', 70], ['ABBIE', 57], ['ABBY', 120], ['ABDUL', 200], ['ABE', 48], ['ABEL', 140], ['ABIGAIL', 328], ['ABRAHAM', 396], ['ABRAM', 350]]
the sum of all the scores is: 871198282
finished in: 0.9668754802862923 seconds
```
